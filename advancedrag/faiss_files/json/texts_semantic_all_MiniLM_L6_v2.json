  "A BIT OF SUNSHINE. \"Mam-ma ,\" said Kate, as she stood at the door, which she had o-pened to let puss in, \"may I not go out and play? the clouds are all gone and the sun shines bright and warm.\" \"But the grass must be quite soaked af-ter all the rain,\" said mam-ma.",
  "Pa-pa was just go-ing out, and had his hat in his hand, but he sat down at once to hear what Kate had to say, and prom- ised that he would take them in half an hour, and so Kate ran up-stairs to ask nurse to put her wraps on.",
  "What a bright af-ter -noon it was; the long rain had made all the grass and leaves look bright and green, and they were rust-ling in the fresh breeze. A-way out at sea the ships were fly-ing be-fore the wind, look-ing like great white birds. Kate's home was at the sea-side, and their drive this af-ter -noon would take them for a time on the beach.[11–12]",
  "The waves, pa-pa said, would be ve-ry wild, for the wind was just right to make a heav-y surf. Soon they be-gan to come to the fish-ing vil-lage. The hous-es were small, and on the beach close to each was drawn up a fish-ing boat. On one of these a man was hard at work.",
  "In the boat it-self was a boy. He was lean-ing o-ver the side and look-ing down at his fa-ther . His hat had blown off, and he looked like such a nice boy that Kate smiled at him as they went by. He laughed back and made her a lit-tle bow, but the hors-es went by so fast that she saw him for a min-ute on-ly .",
  "Just at that mo-ment they passed by a small house. The door stood wide o-pen, and in it sat a young girl. She had a pil- low in her lap and was work-ing o-ver it, Kate thought, with a nee-dle. \"She is mak-ing lace,\" said mam-ma. \"It is hard work, be-cause one has to sit still bent o-ver .",
  "Kate stretched her head out to look, and cried, \"Why , he is mak-ing a boat; what a clev-er boy! See, the hull is done, and two masts are in place. What fun it would be to have a boat to sail on our lit-tle pond.\" \"Our pond is too deep for it to be safe for you to play a-bout it,\" said pa-pa; \"but when you are old-er you shall have a boat with-out fail.",
  "The road now left the vil-lage be-hind and ran a-long the top of some high cliffs. At their feet the sea came in in great waves that were topped with foam, and that broke in a mass of spray . There were two or three per-sons on the beach, and they were walk-ing a-bout and hold-ing up their skirts to keep them from get-tin g wet.",
  "So the hors-es were brought to a halt, and they got down and made their way through a break in the cliffs to the beach. Then, af-ter they had walked a while, they sat down on a great mass of rock and watched the waves as they rolled and broke at their feet.",
  "Kate was much in-ter -est-ed in a piece of board that the waves were tos-sing a-bout. She played that it was a ship, and real-ly felt quite bad-ly when it was dashed a-gainst the rocks. How long they would have stayed there I do not know , but they heard pa-pa shou t-ing that he was tired of wait-ing.",
  "And so they made haste to climb up to where he was and take their seats. Then he spoke to the hors-es and on they went. They had not gone far when they found them- selves in a green lane. Com-ing to-ward them were a lit-tle girl and boy. They were on their way home from school, as the bag in the girl's hand showed, for it had books in it.",
  "As they drew up by the fence to let our par -ty pass, Kate said: \"Their mam-ma lets them walk out though the grass is wet; but I would much rath-er ride this way than walk at a-ny time, or play ei-ther , and so would they , I know .\"[21–22]",
  "I will drive fast-er .\" Soon the drops be-gan to fall, but their car-riage had a top, and they had with them rugs, so that they were not hurt at all. Kate, as she peeped out, saw that all were not so safe. A girl and a boy were crouched close un-der a bush by the road-side.",
  "There goes a girl with her pail to drive the cows to the yard to be milked. Kate must have her sup-per when we get back, and her bed-time is sev-en o'clock, you know .\" \"It is on-ly five now,\" said pa-pa; \"we can have a good hour more, and Kate won't mind, I fan-cy , if she is a lit-tle late for once.\"",
  "Pa-pa and mam-ma both laughed at Kate's tone. She did not like to be laughed at at all, and so, to change the sub-ject, as they went by a house, called out, \"Why , what are that boy and girl do-ing at that hogs-head?\" \"Fish-ing,\" said pa-pa so-ber -ly. \"In a hogs-head!\" said Kate.",
  "Just then pa-pa called out, \"What in the world is this com-ing down the road? Whoa! my boys, stead-y ,\" he said to his hors-es as they be-gan to prick up their ears. The next min-ute they saw what it was. A dog came to-ward them at full speed, howl-ing with fright, while close at his heels was a cat wild with rage.",
  "He will not trou-ble that cat a-gain, I am sure. I won-der what he did to make her so an-gry . Per-haps he teased her kit-tens.\" \"There,\" said Kate, a few min-utes la-ter , \"there is a dog that is not go-ing to be driv-en by a cat. Just look, mam-m a, he wants to get some of that ba-by's sup-per .\"",
  "Mam-ma looked up, and on the porch of a house saw just what you see in this pic-ture—a fat small boy with a slice of bread and but-ter , while a dog al-most as big as the boy looked on wait-ing for a bite. Just at the side gate of the house stood an old cart half full of hay.",
  "So pa-pa drew in his hors-es, and they watched them for a lit-tle while. The birds did not seem to mind them at all. \"There are no bad boys here-a-bout,\" said pa-pa, \"that is ve-ry cer -tain.\" \"I am quite sure,\" said mam-ma, \"that it must be time for us to be home.",
  "I will take a new way home, and we can be there in a ve-ry short time.\" So he turned off in-to a lane close at hand. The hors-es seemed to know that their work was near-ly done, and went on so brisk-ly that just as the hall clock struck six they stopped in front of the door .[39–40]",
  "Nurse was wait-ing on the pi-az-za to meet them, and she jumped Kate out of the car-riage and took her right up to the nur-se-ry , where in a ve-ry short time her tea was all read-y . How hun-gry she was; it seemed to her that bread and milk nev-er tast-ed so good be-fore, and she had her bowl filled three times.",
  "At last she pushed back her chair and said she had had e-nough. Then she be-gan to tell to nurse all she had seen—the boys, and the dogs, and all the pleas-ant sights; and all the time that nurse was get-ting her read-y for bed, her small tongue wagged with-out stop-ping. \"I am get-ting now to be such a big lit-tle wo-man,\" she said to nurse, \"that I don't think I shall go to bed a-ny more till eight; I on-ly just lay a- wake for an hour when I go at sev-en.\" But that night when mam-ma came up, at five min-utes past sev-en, to kiss her good-night, she found her lit-tle girl so fast a-sleep that she did not know at all that she had come.",
  "The next day was bright and fair, and Kate was glad to get out once more. She found that the rain, which had seemed so use-less to her, had been of great ser-vice. Her flow-ers were all look-ing fresh and green, and ev-ery bud was nod- ding its head in the sun-light.",

  "MARLEY'S GHOST Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker , and the chief mourner . Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to.",
  "Old Marley was as dead as a door -nail. Mind! I don't mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country's done for.",
  "You will, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically , that Marley was as dead as a door -nail. Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor , his sole administrator , his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner . And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bar gain.",
  "The mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly understood, or nothin g wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet's father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say St. Paul's Churchyard, for instance—literally to astonish his son's weak mind.",
  "Scrooge never painted out Old Marley's name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley . The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley . Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley , but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.",
  "Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire; secret, and self- contained, and solitary as an oyster . The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin.",
  "He carried his own low temperature always about with him; he iced his of fice in the dog-days, and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas. External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no fallin g snow was more intent upon its purpo se, no pelting rain less open to entreaty .",
  "Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow , and hail, and sleet could boast of the advan tage over him in only one respect. They often 'came down' handsomely , and Scrooge never did. Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, 'My dear Scrooge, how are you?",
  "When will you come to see me?' No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, 'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!'",
  "But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call 'nuts' to Scrooge. Once upon a time—of all the good days in the year, on Christmas Eve—old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.",
  "It was cold, bleak, biting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City clocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already—it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.",
  "The fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense without, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by , and was brewing on a lar ge scale.",
  "The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part.",
  "God save you!' cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's nephew , who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach. 'Bah!' said Scrooge. ' Humbug!' He had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this nephew of Scrooge's, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and handsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again. 'Christmas a humbug, uncle!' said Scrooge's nephew . 'You don't mean that, I am sure?' 'I do,' said Scrooge.",
  "What right have you to be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You're poor enough.' 'Come, then,' returned the nephew gaily . 'What right have you to be dismal? What reason have you to be morose? You're rich enough.' Scrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said, 'Bah!' again; and followed it up with 'Humbug!'",
  "Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What's Christmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself a year older , and not an hour richer; a time for balancing your books, and having every item in 'em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you?",
  "If I could work my will,' said Scrooge indignantly , 'every idiot who goes about with \"Merry Christmas\" on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and burie d with a stake of holly through his heart. He should!' 'Uncle!' pleaded the nephew . 'Nephew!' returned the uncle sternly , 'keep Christmas in your own way , and let me keep it in mine.'",
  "Much good it has ever done you!' 'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare say,' returned the nephew; 'Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when it has come round— apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely , and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.",
  "And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good and will do me good; and I say, God bless it!' The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety , he poked the fire, and extinguished the last frail spark for ever .",
  "You're quite a powerful speaker , sir,' he added, turning to his nephew . 'I wonder you don't go into Parliament.' 'Don't be angry , uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow .' Scrooge said that he would see him——Y es, indeed he did. He went the whole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that extremity first. '",
  "But why?' cried Scrooge's nephew . 'Why?' 'Why did you get married?' said Scrooge. 'Because I fell in love.' 'Because you fell in love!' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. 'Good afternoon!' 'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened.",
  "We have never had any quarrel to which I have been a party . But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas, and I'll keep my Christmas humour to the last. So A Merry Christmas, uncle!' 'Good afternoon,' said Scrooge. ' And A Happy New Year!' 'Good afternoon!' said Scrooge.",
  "His nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned them cordially . 'There's another fellow ,' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: 'my clerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family , talking about a merry Christmas.",
  "I'll retire to Bedlam.' This lunatic, in letting Scrooge's nephe w out, had let two other people in. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with their hats off, in Scrooge's office. They had books and papers in their hands, and bowed to him. 'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe,' said one of the gentlemen, referring to his list. 'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr .",
  "Marley?' 'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,' Scrooge replied. ' He died seven years ago, this very night.' 'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving partner ,' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials. THEY WERE POR TLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD It certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits.",
  "At the ominous word 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the credentials back. 'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman, taking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at the present time.",
  "Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were not.' 'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour , then?' said Scrooge. 'Both very busy , sir.' 'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge.",
  "We choose this time, because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I put you down for?' 'Nothing!' Scrooge replied. 'You wish to be anonymous?' 'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is my answer .",
  "I don't make merry myself at Christmas, and I can't afford to make idle people merry . I help to support the establishments I have mentioned —they cost enough: and those who are badly of f must go there.' 'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.' 'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.",
  "Besides—excuse me —I don't know that.' 'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman. 'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's. Mine occupies me constantly . Good afternoon, gentlemen!' Seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the gentlemen withdrew .",
  "Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him. Meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with flaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in carriages, and conduc t them on their way.",
  "The ancient tower of a church, whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a Gothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there.",
  "The cold became intense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers were repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier , round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture.",
  "The water -plug being left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned to misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy as they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke: a glorious pageant, with which it was next to impo ssible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do.",
  "The Lord Mayor , in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household should; and even the little tailor , whom he had fined five shillings on the previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets, stirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef.",
  "Foggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good St. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such weather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose, gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs, stooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol; but, at the first sound of 'God bless you, merry gentleman, May nothing you dismay!'",
  "Scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled in terror , leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial frost. At length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an ill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuf fed his candle out, and put on his hat.",
  "If I was to stop half-a-crown for it, you'd think yourself ill used, I'll be bound?' The clerk smiled faintly . 'And yet,' said Scrooge, 'you don't think me ill used when I pay a day's wages for no work.' Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve",
  "The clerk observed that it was only once a year . ' A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth of December!' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. 'But I suppose you must have the whole day . Be here all the earlier next morning.' The clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl. The office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no greatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to Camden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man's-buf f. Scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and having read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening with his banker's book, went home to bed.",
  "He lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner . They were a gloomy suite of rooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little business to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house, playing at hide- and-seek with other houses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and dreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms being all let out as offices.",
  "The yard was so dark that even Scrooge, who knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed as if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold.[Pg 17]",
  "Now , it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact that Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residen ce in that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the City of London, even including—which is a bold word—the corporation, aldermen, and livery .",
  "Let it also be borne in mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his last mention of his seven-years'-dead partner that afternoon. And then let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge, having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker , without its under going any intermediate process of change—not a knocker , but Marley's face.",
  "Marley's face. It was not in impenetrable shadow , as the other objects in the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in a dark cellar . It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead.",
  "The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air; and, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless. That, and its livid colour , made it horrible; but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of its own expression.",
  "As Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again. To say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy , would be untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned it sturdily , walked in, and lighted his candle.",
  "He did pause, with a moment's irresolution, before he shut the door; and he did look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of Marley's pigtail sticking out into the hall. But there was nothing on the back of the door , except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, 'Pooh, pooh!'",
  "The sound resounded through the house like thunder . Every room above, and every cask in the wine-merchant's cellars below , appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes. He fastened the door , and walked across the hall, and up the stairs: slowly , too: trimming his candle as he went.",
  "You may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight of stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say you migh t have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise, with the splinter -bar towards the wall, and the door towards the balustrades: and done it easy.",
  "There was plenty of width for that, and room to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen gas-lamps out of the stree t wouldn't have lighted the entry too well, so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge's dip.",
  "Up Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through his rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that. Sitting-room, bedroom, lumber -room.",
  "All as they should be. Nobody under the table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and basin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall.",
  "Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall Quite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double locked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against surprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers, and his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.",
  "It was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was obliged to sit close to it, and brood over it, before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel. The fireplace was an old one, built by some Dutch merchant long ago, and paved all round with quaint Dutch tiles, designed to illustrate the Scriptures.",
  "There were Cains and Abels, Pharaoh's daughters, Queens of Sheba, Angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like feather -beds, Abrahams, Belshazzars, Apostles putting off to sea in butter -boats, hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts; and yet that face of Marley , seven years dead, came like the ancient Prophet's rod, and swallowed up the whole.",
  "If each smooth tile had been a blank at first, with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts, there would have been a copy of old Marley's head on every one. 'Humbug!' said Scrooge; and walked across the room. After several turns he sat down again.",
  "As he threw his head back in the chair , his glance happened to rest upon a bell, a disused bell, that hung in the room, and communicated, for some purpose now forgotten, with a chamber in the highest storey of the building. It was with great astonishment, and with a strange, inexplicable dread, that, as he looked, he saw this bell begin to swing. It swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound; but soon it rang out loudly , and so did every bell in the house.",
  "This might have lasted half a minute, or a minute, but it seemed an hour. The bells ceased, as they had begun, together . They were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the wine-merchant's cellar .",
  "The cellar door flew open with a boom ing sound, and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below; then coming up the stairs; then coming straight towards his door . 'It's humbug still!' said Scrooge. 'I won't believe it.' His colour changed, though, when, without a pause, it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes.",
  "Upon its coming in, the dying flame leaped up, as though it cried, 'I know him! Marley's Ghost!' and fell again. The same face: the very same. Marley in his pigtail, usual waistcoat, tights, and boots; the tassels on the latter bristling, like his pigtail, and his coat-skirts, and the hair upon his head.",
  "The chain he drew was clasped about his middle. It was long, and wound about him like a tail; and it was made (for Scrooge observed it closely) of cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy purses wrough t in steel. His body was transparent: so that Scrooge, observing him, and looking through his waistcoat, could see the two buttons on his coat behind.",
  "Scrooge had often heard it said that Marley had no bowels, but he had never believed it until now . No, nor did he believe it even now. Though he looked the phantom through and through, and saw it standing before him; though he felt the chilling influence of its death-cold eyes, and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin, which wrapper he had not observed before, he was still incredulous, and fought against his senses.",
  "He was going to say 'to a shade,' but substituted this, as more appropriate. 'In life I was your partner , Jacob Marley .' 'Can you—can you sit down?' asked Scrooge, looking doubtfully at him. 'I can.' 'Do it, then.' Scrooge asked the question, because he didn't know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair; and felt that in the event of its being impossible, it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation. But the Ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace, as if he were quite used to it.",
  "A slight disorder of the stom ach makes them cheats. You may be an undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard , a crumb of cheese, a fragment of an underdone potato. There's more of gravy than of grave about you, whatever you are!' Scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes, nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then.",
  "The truth is, that he tried to be smart, as a means of distracting his own attention, and keeping down his terror; for the spectre's voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones. To sit staring at those fixed, glazed eyes in silence, for a moment, would play, Scrooge felt, the very deuce with him.",
  "There was something very awful, too, in the spectre's being provided with an infernal atmosphere of his own. Scrooge could not feel it himself, but this was clearly the case; for though the Ghost sat perfectly motionless, its hair, and skirts, and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven.",
  "Humbug, I tell you: humbug!' At this the spirit raised a frightful cry, and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise, that Scrooge held on tight to his chair , to save himself from falling in a swoon. But how much greater was his horror when the phantom, taking off the bandage round his head, as if it were too warm to wear indoors, its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast!",
  "Scrooge fell upon his knees, and clasped his hands before his face. 'Mercy!' he said. 'Dreadful apparition, why do you trouble me?' 'Man of the worldly mind!' replied the Ghost, 'do you believe in me or not?' 'I do,' said Scrooge; 'I must. But why do spirits walk the earth, and why do they come to me?'",
  "It is doomed to wander through the world—oh, woe is me!—and witness what it cannot share, but might have shared on earth, and turned to happiness!' Again the spectre raised a cry , and shook its chain and wrung its shadowy hands. 'You are fettered,' said Scrooge, trembling. 'T ell me why?'",
  "Is its pattern strange to you?' Scrooge trembled more and more. 'Or would you know ,' pursued the Ghost, 'the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as heavy and as long as this seven Christmas Eves ago. You have laboured on it since.",
  "It is a ponderous chain!' Scrooge glanced about him on the floor , in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable; but he could see nothing. ' Jacob!' he said imploringly . ' Old Jacob Marley , tell me more! Speak comfort to me, Jacob!'",
  "Nor can I tell you what I would. A very little more is all permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger anywhere. My spirit never walked beyond our counting-house—mark me;—in life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!'",
  "ON THE WINGS OF THE WIND 'You must have been very slow about it, Jacob,' Scrooge observed in a business-like manner , though with humility and deference. 'Slow!' the Ghost repeated. 'Seven years dead,' mused Scrooge. ' And travelling all the time?' 'The whole time,' said the Ghost. ' No rest, no peace.",
  "The Ghost, on hearing this, set up another cry, and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night, that the Ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance. ' Oh! captive, bound, and double-ironed,' cried the phantom, 'not to know that ages of incessant labour , by immortal creatures, for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed! Not to know that any Christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere, whatever it may be, will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness!",
  "Not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one life's opportunities misused! Yet such was I! Oh, such was I!' 'But you were always a good man of business, Jacob,' faltered Scrooge, who now began to apply this to himself. 'Business!' cried the Ghost, wringing its hands again.",
  "The common welfare was my business; charity , mercy , forbearance, and benevolence were, all, my business. The dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business!' It held up its chain at arm's-length, as if that were the cause of all its unavailing grief, and flung it heavily upon the ground again.",
  "Why did I walk through crowds of fellow-beings with my eyes turned down, and never raise them to that blessed Star which led the Wise Men to a poor abode? Were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me?' Scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this rate, and began to quake exceedingly .",
  "Don't be flowery , Jacob! Pray!' 'How it is that I appear before you in a shape that you can see, I may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you many and many a day .' It was not an agreeable idea. Scrooge shivered, and wiped the perspiration from his brow .[Pg 30]",
  "A chance and hope of my procuring, Ebenezer .' 'You were always a good friend to me,' said Scrooge. 'Thankee!' 'You will be haunted,' resumed the Ghost, 'by Three Spirits.' Scrooge's countenance fell almost as low as the Ghost's had done. 'Is that the chance and hope you mentioned, Jacob?' he demanded in a faltering voice.",
  "It is.' 'I—I think I'd rather not,' said Scrooge. 'Without their visits,' said the Ghost, 'you cannot hope to shun the path I tread. Expect the first to-morrow when the bell tolls One.' 'Couldn't I take 'em all at once, and have it over , Jacob?' hinted Scrooge. 'Expect the second on the next night at the same hour.",
  "The third, upon the next night when the last stroke of Twelve has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more; and look that, for your own sake, you remember what has passed between us!' When it had said these words, the spectre took its wrapper from the table, and bound it round its head as before.",
  "Scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought toget her by the bandage. He ventured to raise his eyes again, and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude, with its chain wound over and about its arm. The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went[Pg 32]",
  "The apparition walked backward from him; and, at every step it took, the window raised itself a little, so that, when the spectre reached it, it was wide open. It beckoned Scrooge to approach, which he did. When they were within two paces of each other , Marley's Ghost held up its hand, warning him to come no nearer .",
  "Scrooge stopped. Not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear; for, on the raising of the hand, he became sensible of confused noises in the air; incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret; wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and self-accusatory . The spectre, after listening for a moment, joined in the mournful dir ge; and floated out upon the bleak, dark night.",
  "Scrooge followed to the window: desperate in his curiosity . He looked out. The air was filled with phantoms, wandering hither and thither in restless haste, and moaning as they went. Every one of them wore chains like Marley's Ghost; some few (they might be guilty governments) were linked together; none were free.",
  "Many had been personally known to Scrooge in their lives. He had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat, with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle, who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant, whom it saw below upon a doorstep.",
  "The misery with them all was clearly , that they sought to interfere, for good, in human matters, and had lost the power for ever . Whether these creatures faded into mist, or mist enshrouded them, he could not tell. But they and their spirit voices faded together; and the night became as it had been when he walked home.",
  "Scrooge closed the window , and examined the door by which the Ghost had entered. It was double locked, as he had locked it with his own hands, and the bolts were undisturbed. He tried to say 'Humbug!' but stopped at the first syllable. And being, from the emotions he had under gone, or the fatigues of the day, or his glimpse of the Invisible World, or the dull conversation of the Ghost, or the lateness of the hour, much in need of repose, went straight to bed without undressing, and fell asleep upon the instant.",
  "THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPIRITS When Scrooge awoke it was so dark, that, looking out of bed, he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber . He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.",
  "So he listened for the hour . To his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and from seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve! It was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must have got into the works.",
  "Twelve! He touched the spring of his repeater , to correct this most preposterous clock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped. 'Why , it isn't possible,' said Scrooge, 'that I can have slept through a whole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!'",
  "The idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his way to the window . He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very little then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and extremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and fro, and making a great stir, as there unquest ionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world.",
  "This was a great relief, because 'Three days after sight of this First of Exchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order ,' and so forth, would have become a mere United States security if there were no days to count by . Scrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over and over, and could make nothing of it.",
  "The more he thought, the more perplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he thought. Marley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly . Every time he resolved within hims elf, after mature inquiry that it was all a dream, his mind flew back again, like a strong spring released, to its first positio n, and presented the same problem to be worked all through, 'W as it a dream or not?'",
  "Scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more, when he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest resolution in his power . The quarter was so long, that he was more than once convinced he must have sunk into a doze unconsciously , and missed the clock.",
  "He spoke before the hour bell sounded, which it now did with a deep, dull, hollow, melancholy One. Light flashed up in the room upon the instant, and the curtains of his bed were drawn. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside, I tell you, by a hand. Not the curtains at his feet, nor the curtains at his back, but those to which his face was addressed. The curtains of his bed were drawn aside; and Scrooge, starting up into a half- recumbent attitude, found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them: as close to it as I am now to you, and I am standing in the spirit at your elbow .",
  "It was a strange figure—like a child; yet not so like a child as like an old man, viewed through some supernatural medium, which gave him the appearanc e of having receded from the view , and being diminished to a child's proportions. Its hair, which hung about its neck and down its back, was white, as if with age; and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it, and the tenderest bloom was on the skin.",
  "The arms were very long and muscular; the hands the same, as if its hold were of uncommon strength. Its legs and feet, most delicately formed, were, like those upper members, bare. It wore a tunic of the purest white; and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt, the sheen of which was beautiful.",
  "It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and, in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem, had its dress trimmed with summer flowers. But the strangest thing about it was, that from the crown of its head there spran g a bright clear jet of light, by which all this was visible; and which was doubtless the occasion of its using, in its duller moments, a great extinguisher for a cap, which it now held under its arm.",
  "Even this, though, when Scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness, was not its strangest quality . For, as its belt sparkled and glittered, now in one part and now in another , and what was light one instant at another time was dark, so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness; being now a thing with one arm, now with one leg, now with twenty legs, now a pair of legs without a head, now a head without a body: of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away .",
  "And, in the very wonder of this, it would be itself again; distinct and clear as ever. 'Are you the Spirit, sir , whose coming was foretold to me?' asked Scrooge. 'I am!' The voice was soft and gentle. Singularly low , as if, instead of being so close behind him, it were at a distance.",
  "Scrooge demanded. 'I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.' 'Long Past?' inquired Scrooge, observant of its dwarfish stature. ' No. Your past.' Perhaps Scrooge could not have told anybody why, if anybody could have asked him; but he had a special desire to see the Spirit in his cap, and begged him to be covered. 'What!' exclaimed the Ghost, 'would you so soon put out, with worldly hands, the light I give?",
  "Is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap, and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow?' Scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully 'bonneted' the Spirit at any period of his life.",
  "He then made bold to inquire what business brought him there. 'Your welfare!' said the Ghost. Scrooge expressed himself much obliged, but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end. The Spirit must have heard him thinking, for it said immediately— 'Your reclamation, then.",
  "It would have been in vain for Scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes; that bed was warm, and the thermometer a long way below freezing; that he was clad but lightly in his slippers, dressing- gown, and nightcap; and that he had a cold upon him at that time.",
  "The grasp, though gentle as a woman's hand, was not to be resisted. He rose; but, finding that the Spirit made towards the window , clasped its robe in supplication. 'I am a mortal,' Scrooge remonstrated, 'and liable to fall.' 'Bear but a touch of my hand there,' said the Spirit, laying it upon his heart, 'and you shall be upheld in more than this!'",
  "As the words were spoken, they passed through the wall, and stood upon an open country road, with fields on either hand. The city had entirely vanished. Not a vestige of it was to be seen. The darkness and the mist had vanished with it, for it was a clear , cold, winter day , with snow upon the ground. '",
  "Good Heaven!' said Scrooge, clasping his hands together , as he looked about him. 'I was bred in this place. I was a boy here!' The Spirit gazed upon him mildly . Its gentle touch, though it had been light and instantaneous, appeared still present to the old man's sense of feeling.",
  "He was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air, each one connected with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and cares long, long for gotten! ' Your lip is trembling,' said the Ghost. ' And what is that upon your cheek?' Scrooge muttered, with an unusual catch ing in his voice, that it was a pimple; and begged the Ghost to lead him where he would.",
  "Let us go on.' They walked along the road, Scrooge recognising every gate, and post, and tree, until a little market-town appeared in the distance, with its bridge, its church, and winding river. Some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs, who called to other boys in country gigs and carts, driven by farmers.",
  "All these boys were in great spirits, and shouted to each other , until the broad fields were so full of merry music, that the crisp air laughed to hear it. 'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost. 'They have no consciousness of us.'",
  "The jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named them every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why did his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry Christmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several homes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!",
  "What good had it ever done to him? 'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is left there still.' Scrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed. They left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick, with a little weather -cock surmounted cupola on the roof, and a bell hanging in it.",
  "It was a large house, but one of broken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls were damp and mossy , their windows broken, and their gates decayed. Fowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and sheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the open doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnishe d, cold, and vast.",
  "There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the place, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candle light and not too much to eat. They went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back of the house.",
  "It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare, melancholy room , made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and Scrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he had used to be. Not a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling, not a drip from the half- thawed waterspout in the dull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar , not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a clicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening influence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.",
  "The Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self, intent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully real and distinct to look at, stood outside the window , with an axe stuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.[Pg 43]",
  "Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy . 'It's dear old honest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know . One Christmas-time, when yonder solitary child was left here all alone, he did come, for the first time, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his wild brother , Orson; there they go!",
  "And what's his name, who was put down in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him? And the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon his head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be married to the Princess?'",
  "To hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and to see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to his business friends in the City, indeed. 'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!",
  "Poor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing round the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin Crusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the Parrot, you know . There goes Friday , running for his life to the little creek!",
  "Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!' Then, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character , he said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again. 'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking about him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now .'",
  "There was a boy singing a Christmas carol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something: that's all.' The Ghost smiled thoughtfully , and waved its hand, saying as it did so, 'Let us see another Christmas!' Scrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a little darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked; fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked laths were shown instead; but how all this was brought about Scrooge knew no more than you do.",
  "He only knew that it was quite correct; that everything had happened so; that there he was, alone again, when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays. He was not reading now, but walking up and down despairingly . Scrooge looked at the Ghost, and, with a mournful shaking of his head, glanced anxiously towards the door .",
  "It opened; and a little girl, much younger than the boy, came darting in, and, putting her arms about his neck, and often kissing him, addressed him as her 'dear , dear brother .' 'I have come to bring you home, dear brother!' said the child, clapping her tiny hands, and bending down to laugh. 'To bring you home, home, home!'",
  "Home for ever and ever. Father is so much kinder than he used to be, that home's like heaven! He spoke so gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed, that I was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home; and he said Yes, you should; and sent me in a coach to bring you.",
  "And you're to be a man!' said the child, opening her eyes; 'and are never to come back here; but first we're to be together all the Christmas long, and have the merriest time in all the world.' 'You are quite a woman, little Fan!' exclaimed the boy . She clapped her hands and laughed, and tried to touch his head; but, being too little laughed again, and stood on tiptoe to embrace him.",
  "Then she began to drag him, in her childish eagerness, towards the door; and he, nothing loath to go, accompanied her . A terrible voice in the hall cried, 'Bring down Master Scrooge's box, there!' and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself, who glared on Master Scrooge with a ferocious condescension, and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him.",
  "He then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour that ever was seen, where the maps upon the wall, and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows, were waxy with cold. Here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine, and a block of curiously heavy cake, and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people; at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of 'something' to the postboy , who answered that he thanked the gentleman, but, if it was the same tap as he had tasted before, he had rather not.",
  "Master Scrooge's trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise, the children bade the schoolmaster good- bye right willingly; and, getting into it, drove gaily down the garden sweep; the quick wheels dashing the hoar-frost and snow from of f the dark leaves of the ever greens like spray .[Pg 47]",
  "HE PRODUCED A DECANTER OF CURIOUSL Y LIGHT WINE, AND A BLOCK OF CURIOUSL Y HEA VY CAKE 'Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have withered,' said the Ghost. 'But she had a lar ge heart!' 'So she had,' cried Scrooge. ' Y ou're right. I will not gainsay it, Spirit.",
  "God forbid!' 'She died a woman,' said the Ghost, 'and had, as I think, children.' 'One child,' Scrooge returned. 'True,' said the Ghost. ' Y our nephew!' Scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind, and answered briefly , 'Yes.' Although they had but that moment left the school behind them, they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city, where shadowy passengers passed and re-passed; where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way, and all the strife and tumult of a real city were.",
  "It was made plain enough, by the dressing of the shops, that here, too, it was Christmas-time again; but it was evening, and the streets were lighted up. The Ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door , and asked Scrooge if he knew it. 'Know it!' said Scrooge. ' W as I apprenticed here?'",
  "They went in. At sight of an old gentleman in a Welsh wig, sitting behind such a high desk, that if he had been two inches taller , he must have knocked his head against the ceiling, Scrooge cried in great excitement — 'Why , it's old Fezziwig! Bless his heart, it's Fezziwig alive again!'",
  "Old Fezziwig laid down his pen, and looked up at the clock, which pointed to the hour of seven. He rubbed his hands; adjusted his capacious waistcoat; laughed all over himself, from his shoes to his organ of benevolence; and called out, in a comfortable, oily , rich, fat, jovial voice— 'Yo ho, there!",
  "Ebenezer! Dick!' Scrooge's former self, now grown a young man, came briskly in, accompanied by his fellow-'prentice. ' Dick Wilkins, to be sure!' said Scrooge to the Ghost. 'Bless me, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me, was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear , dear!' 'Yo ho, my boys!' said Fezziwig. '",
  "You wouldn't believe how those two fellows went at it! They charged into the street with the shutters—one, two, three— had 'em up in their places—four , five, six—barred 'em and pinned 'em—seven, eight, nine—and came back before you could have got to twelve, panting like racehorses. 'Hilli-ho!' cried old Fezziwig, skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility .",
  "Hilli-ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!' Clear away! There was nothing they wouldn't have cleared away , or couldn't have cleared away , with old Fezziwig looking on. It was done in a minute. Every movable was packed off, as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore; the floor was swept and watered, the lamps were trimmed, fuel was heaped upon the fire; and the warehouse was as snug, and warm, and dry , and bright a ball-room as you would desire to see upon a winter's night.",
  "In came a fiddler with a music-book, and went up to the lofty desk, and made an orchestra of it, and tuned like fifty stomach-aches. In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile. In came the three Miss Fezziwigs, beaming and lovable. In came the six young followers whose hearts they broke.",
  "In came all the young men and women employed in the business. In came the housemaid, with her cousin the baker . In came the cook with her brother's particular friend the milkman. In came the boy from over the way, who was suspected of not having board enough from his master; trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one, who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress.",
  "In they all came, one after another; some shyly , some boldly , some grace fully, some awkwardly , some pushing, some pulling; in they all came, any how and every how. Away they all went, twenty couple at once; hands half round and back again the other way; down the middle and up again; round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping; old top couple always turning up in the wrong place; new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there; all top couples at last, and not a bottom one to help them!",
  "When this result was brought about, old Fezziwig, clapping his hands to stop the dance, cried out, 'Well done!' and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter , especially provided for that purpose. But, scorning rest upon his reappearance, he instantly began again, though there were no dancers yet, as if the other fiddler had been carried home, exhausted, on a shutter , and he were a bran-new man resolved to beat him out of sight, or perish.",
  "There were more dances, and there were forfeits, and more dances, and there was cake, and there was negus, and there was a great piece of Cold Roast, and there was a great piece of Cold Boiled, and there were mince-pies, and plenty of beer. But the great effect of the evening came after the Roast and Boiled, when the fiddler (an artful dog, mind!",
  "The sort of man who knew his business better than you or I could have told it him!) struck up 'Sir Roger de Coverley .' Then old Fezziwig stood out to dance with Mrs. Fezziwig. Top couple, too; with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them; three or four and twenty pair of partners; people who were not to be trifled with; people who would dance, and had no notion of walking.",
  "But if they had been twice as many—ah! four times—old Fezziwig would have been a match for them, and so would Mrs. Fezziwig. As to her, she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term. If that's not high praise, tell me higher , and I'll use it.",
  "A positive light appeared to issue from Fezziwig's calves. They shone in every part of the dance like moons. You couldn't have predicted, at any given time, what would become of them next. And when old Fezziwig and Mrs. Fezziwig had gone all through the dance; advance and retire, both hands to your partner , bow and curtsy , cork- screw , thread-the-needle, and back again to your place: Fezziwig 'cut'—cut so deftly , that he appeared to wink with his legs, and came upon his feet again without a stagger .",
  "When the clock struck eleven, this domestic ball broke up. Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig took their stations, one on either side the door, and, shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out, wished him or her a Merry Christmas. When everybody had retired but the two 'prentices, they did the same to them; and thus the cheerful voices died away , and the lads were left to their beds; which were under a counter in the back-shop.",
  "During the whole of this time Scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits. His heart and soul were in the scene, and with his former self. He corroborated everyt hing, remembered everything, enjoyed everything, and underwent the strangest agitation. It was not until now, when the bright faces of his former self and Dick were turned from them, that he remembered the Ghost, and became conscious that it was looking full upon him, while the light upon its head burnt very clear .",
  "The Spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices, who were pouring out their hearts in praise of Fezziwig; and when he had done so, said: 'Why! Is it not? He has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money: three or four, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves this praise?'",
  "He has the power to render us happy or unhappy; to make our service light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. Say that his power lies in words and looks; in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count 'em up: what then? The happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune.'",
  "He felt the Spirit's glance, and stopped. 'What is the matter?' asked the Ghost. 'Nothing particular ,' said Scrooge. 'Something, I think?' the Ghost insisted. 'No,' said Scrooge, 'no. I should like to be able to say a word or two to my clerk just now . That's all.' His former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish; and Scrooge and the Ghost again stood side by side in the open air .",
  "This was not addressed to Scrooge, or to any one whom he could see, but it produced an immediate effect. For again Scrooge saw himself. He was older now; a man in the prime of life. His face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years; but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice.",
  "There was an eager , greedy , restless motion in the eye, which showed the passion that had taken root, and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall. He was not alone, but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning dress: in whose eyes there were tears, which sparkled in the light that shone out of the Ghost of Christmas Past.",
  "I have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master passion, Gain, engrosses you. Have I not?' 'What then?' he retorted. 'Even if I have grown so much wiser , what then? I am not changed towards you.' She shook her head. 'Am I?' 'Our contract is an old one.",
  "It was made when we were both poor, and content to be so, until, in good season, we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry . You are changed. When it was made you were another man.' 'I was a boy ,' he said impatiently . 'Your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are,' she returned.",
  "That which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two. How often and how keenly I have thought of this I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can release you.' 'Have I ever sought release?'",
  "No. Never .' 'In what, then?' 'In a changed nature; in an altered spirit ; in another atmosphere of life; another Hope as its great end. In everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight. If this had never been between us,' said the girl, looking mildly , but with steadiness, upon him; 'tell me, would you seek me out and try to win me now?",
  "Ah, no!' He seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of himself. But he said, with a struggle, 'Y ou think not.' 'I would gladly think otherwise if I could,' she answered. 'Heaven knows! When I have learned a Truth like this, I know how strong and irresistible it must be.",
  "But if you were free to-day , to-morrow , yesterday , can even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you who, in your very confidence with her, weigh everything by Gain: or, choosing her, if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so, do I not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow?",
  "SHE LEFT HIM, AND THEY PARTED He was about to speak; but, with her head turned from him, she resumed: 'You may—the memory of what is past half makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief time, and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly , as an unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you awoke.",
  "May you be happy in the life you have chosen!' She left him, and they parted. 'Spirit!' said Scrooge, 'show me no more! Conduct me home. Why do you delight to torture me?' 'One shadow more!' exclaimed the Ghost. 'No more!' cried Scrooge. 'No more! I don't wish to see it.",
  "Show me no more!' But the relentless Ghost pinioned him in both his arms, and forced him to observe what happened next. They were in another scene and place; a room, not very large or handsome, but full of comfort. Near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl, so like that last that Scrooge believed it was the same, until he saw her, now a comely matron, sitting opposite her daughter .",
  "The noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous, for there were more children there than Scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count; and, unlike the celebrated herd in the poem, they were not forty children conducting themselves like one, but every child was conducting itself like forty .",
  "The consequences were uproarious beyond belief; but no one seemed to care; on the contrary , the mother and daughter laughed heartily , and enjoyed it very much; and the latter , soon beginning to mingle in the sports, got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly . What would I not have given to be one of them!",
  "Though I never could have been so rude, no, no! I wouldn't for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair, and torn it down; and for the precious little shoe, I wouldn't have plucked it off, God bless my soul! to save my life. As to measuring her waist in sport, as they did, bold young brood, I couldn't have done it; I should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment, and never come straight again.",
  "And yet I should have dearly liked, I own, to have touched her lips; to have questioned her, that she might have opened them; to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes, and never raised a blush; to have let loose waves of hair, an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price: in short, I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the lightest license of a child, and yet to have been man enough to know its value.[Pg 61]",
  "A flushed and boisterous group But now a knocking at the door was heard, and such a rush immediately ensued that she, with laughing face and plundered dress, was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group, just in time to greet the father , who came home attended by a man laden with Christmas toys and presents.",
  "Then the shouting and the struggling, and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter! The scaling him, with chairs for ladders, to dive into his pockets, despoil him of brown-paper parcels, hold on tight by his cravat, hug him round his neck, pummel his back, and kick his legs in irrepressible affection!",
  "The shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received! The terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a doll's frying pan into his mouth, and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey , glued on a wooden platter!",
  "The immense relief of finding this a false alarm! The joy, and gratitude, and ecstasy! They are all indescribable alike. It is enough that, by degrees, the children and their emotions got out of the parlour , and, by one stair at a time, up to the top of the house, where they went to bed, and so subsided.",
  "And now Scrooge looked on more attentively than ever, when the master of the house, having his daughter leaning fondly on him, sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside; and when he thought that such another creature, quite as graceful and as full of promise, might have called him father , and been a spring-time in the haggard winter of his life, his sight grew very dim indeed.",
  "Tut, don't I know?' she added in the same breath, laughing as he laughed. ' Mr . Scrooge.' 'Mr. Scrooge it was. I passed his office window; and as it was not shut up, and he had a candle inside, I could scarcely help seeing him. His partner lies upon the point of death, I hear; and there he sat alone.",
  "Scrooge exclaimed, 'I cannot bear it!' He turned upon the Ghost, and seeing that it looked upon him with a face, in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces it had shown him, wrestled with it. 'Leave me! Take me back. Haunt me no longer!'",
  "In the struggle, if that can be called a struggle in which the Ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary , Scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright; and dimly connecting that with its influence over him, he seized the extinguisher -cap, and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head. Laden with Christmas toys and presents The Spirit dropped beneath it, so that the extinguisher covered its whole form; but though Scrooge pressed it down with all his force, he could not hide the light, which streamed from under it, in an unbroken flood upon the ground.",
  "He was conscious of being exhausted, and overcome by an irresistible drows iness; and, further , of being in his own bedroom. He gave the cap a parting squeeze, in which his hand relaxed; and had barely time to reel to bed, before he sank into a heavy sleep.[Pg 65]",
  "STAVE THREE THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS Awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore, and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together , Scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of One. He felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time, for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through Jacob Marley's intervention.",
  "But finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back, he put them every one aside with his own hands, and, lying down again, established a sharp look-out all round the bed. For he wished to challenge the Spirit on the moment of its appearance, and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous.",
  "Gentlemen of the free-and-easy sort, who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two, and being usually equal to the time of day, express the wide range of their capacity for advent ure by observing that they are good for anything from pitch-and-toss to manslaughter; between which opposite extremes, no doubt, there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects.",
  "Without venturing for Scrooge quite as hardily as this, I don't mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances, and that nothing between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much.[Pg 66] [Pg 67] [Pg 68] [Pg 69] [Pg 70]",
  "Now , being prepared for almost anythin g, he was not by any means prepared for nothing; and consequently , when the bell struck One, and no shape appeared, he was taken with a violent fit of tremb ling. Five minutes, ten minutes, a quarter of an hour went by, yet nothing came.",
  "All this time he lay upon his bed, the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light, which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour; and which, being only light, was more alarming than a dozen ghosts, as he was powerless to make out what it meant, or would be at; and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interes ting case of spontaneous combustion, without having the consolation of knowing it. At last, however , he began to think—as you or I would have thought at first; for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it, and would unques tionably have done it too—at last, I say, he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room, from whence, on further tracing it, it seemed to shine.",
  "This idea taking full possession of his mind, he got up softly , and shuffled in his slippers to the door . The moment Scrooge's hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by his name, and bade him enter . He obeyed. It was his own room.",
  "There was no doubt about that. But it had under gone a surprising transformation. The walls and ceiling were so hung with living green, that it looked a perfect grove; from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened. The crisp leaves of holly , mistletoe, and ivy reflected back the light, as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there; and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in Scrooge's time, or Marley's, or for many and many a winter season gone.",
  "Heaped up on the floor , to form a kind of throne, were turkeys, geese, game, poultry , brawn, great joints of meat, sucking-pigs, long wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum-puddings, barrels of oysters, red-hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious pears, immense twelfth-cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam.",
  "In easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly Giant, glorious to see; who bore a glowing torch, in shape not unlike Plenty's horn, and held it up, high up, to shed its light on Scrooge as he came peeping round the door . 'Come in!' exclaimed the Ghost.",
  "Scrooge entered timidly , and hung his head before this Spirit. He was not the dogged Scrooge he had been; and though the Spirit's eyes were clear and kind, he did not like to meet them. 'I am the Ghost of Christmas Present,' said the Spirit. 'Look upon me!' Scrooge reverently did so.",
  "It was clothed in one simple deep green robe, or mantle, bordered with white fur. This garment hung so loosely on the figure, that its capacious breast was bare, as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice. Its feet, observable beneath the ample folds of the garment, were also bare; and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath, set here and there with shining icicles.",
  "Its dark-brown curls were long and free; free as its genial face, its sparkling eye, its open hand, its cheery voice, its unconstrained demeanour , and its joyful air. Girded round its middle was an antique scabbard: but no sword was in it, and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust.",
  "Have you had many brothers, Spirit?' 'More than eighteen hundred,' said the Ghost. 'A tremendous family to provide for ,' muttered Scrooge. The Ghost of Christmas Present rose. 'Spirit,' said Scrooge submissively , 'conduct me where you will. I went forth last night on compulsion, and I learned a lesson which is working now .",
  "To-night if you have aught to teach me, let me profit by it.' 'Touch my robe!' Scrooge did as he was told, and held it fast. Holly , mistletoe, red berries, ivy, turkeys, geese, game, poultry , brawn, meat, pigs, sausages, oysters, pies, puddings, fruit, and punch, all vanished instantly .",
  "So did the room, the fire, the ruddy glow , the hour of night, and they stood in the city streets on Christmas morning, where (for the weather was severe) the people made a rough, but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music, in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwel lings, and from the tops of their houses, whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below , and splitting into artificial little snowstorms.[Pg 71]",
  "The house-fronts looked black enough, and the windows blacker , contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs, and with the dirtier snow upon the ground; which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons: furrows that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off; and made intricate channels, hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water .",
  "The sky was gloomy , and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist, half thawed, half frozen, whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms, as if all the chimneys in Great Britain had, by one consent, caught fire, and were blazing away to their dear heart's content.",
  "There was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town, and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain. THERE WAS NOTHING VER Y CHEERFUL IN THE CLIMA TE For the people who were shovelling away on the house-tops were jovial and full of glee; calling out to one another from the parapets, and now and then exchanging a facetious snowball—better -natured missile far than many a wordy jest— laughing heartily if it went right, and not less heartily if it went wrong.",
  "The poulterers' shops were still half open, and the fruiterers' were radiant in their glory . There were great, round, pot-bellied baskets of chestnuts, shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen, lolling at the doors, and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence: There were ruddy , brown-faced, broad-girthed Spanish onions, shining in the fatness of their growth like Spanish friars, and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by, and glanced demurely at the hung-up mistletoe. There were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids; there were bunches of grapes, made, in the shopkeepers' benevolence, to dangle from conspicuous hooks that people's mouths might water gratis as they passed; there were piles of filberts, mossy and brown, recalling, in their fragrance, ancient walks among the woods, and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves; there were Norfolk Biffins, squab and swarthy , setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons, and, in the great compactness of their juicy persons, urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner .",
  "The Grocers'! oh, the Grocers'! nearly closed, with perhaps two shutters down, or one; but through those gaps such glimpses! It was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound, or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly , or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks, or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose, or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare, the almonds so extremely white, the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight, the other spices so delicious, the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookers-on feel faint, and subsequently bilious.",
  "Nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy , or that the French plums blushed in modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly , and left their purchases upon the counter , and came running back to fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in the best humour possible; while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh, that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own, worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws to peck at if they chose.",
  "But soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel, and away they came, flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces. And at the same time there emer ged, from scores of by-streets, lanes, and nameless turnings, innumerable people, carrying their dinners to the bakers' shops.",
  "The sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the Spirit very much, for he stood with Scrooge beside him in a baker's doorway , and, taking off the covers as their bearers passed, sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch. And it was a very uncommon kind of torch, for once or twice, when there were angry words between some dinner -carriers who had jostled each other , he shed a few drops of water on them from it, and their good-humour was restored directly .",
  "For they said, it was a shame to quarrel upon Christmas Day . And so it was! God love it, so it was! In time the bells ceased, and the bakers were shut up; and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners, and the progress of their cooking, in the thawed blotch of wet above each baker 's oven, where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too.",
  "My own.' 'Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?' asked Scrooge. 'To any kindly given. To a poor one most.' 'Why to a poor one most?' asked Scrooge. 'Because it needs it most.' 'Spirit!' said Scrooge, after a moment's thought, 'I wonder you, of all the beings in the many worlds about us, should desire to cramp these people's opportunities of innocent enjoyment.",
  "And it comes to the same thing.' 'I seek!' exclaimed the Spirit. 'Forgive me if I am wrong. It has been done in your name, or at least in that of your family ,' said Scrooge. 'There are some upon this earth of yours,' returned the Spirit, 'who lay claim to know us, and who do their deeds of passion, pride, ill-will, hatred, envy , bigotry , and selfishness in our name, who are as strange to us, and all our kith and kin, as if they had never lived.",
  "Remember that, and char ge their doings on themselves, not us.' Scrooge promised that he would; and they went on, invisible, as they had been before, into the suburbs of the town. It was a remarkable quality of the Ghost (which Scrooge had observed at the baker's), that notwithstanding his gigantic size, he could accommodate himself to any place with ease; and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall.[Pg 78]",
  "And perhaps it was the pleasure the good Spirit had in showing off this power of his, or else it was his own kind, generous, hearty nature, and his sympath y with all poor men, that led him straight to Scrooge's clerk's; for there he went, and took Scrooge with him, holding to his robe; and on the threshold of the door the Spirit smiled, and stopped to bless Bob Cratchit's dwelling with the sprink lings of his torch.",
  "Think of that! Bob had but fifteen 'Bob' a week himself; he pocketed on Saturdays but fifteen copie s of his Christian name; and yet the Ghost of Christmas Present blessed his four- roomed house! Then up rose Mrs. Cratchit, Cratchit's wife, dressed out but poorly in a twice-turned gown, but brave in ribbons, which are cheap, and make a goodly show for sixpence; and she laid the cloth, assisted by Belinda Cratchit, second of her daughters, also brave in ribbons; while Master Peter Cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes, and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt-collar (Bob's private property , conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day,) into his mouth, rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired, and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable Parks. And now two smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that outside the baker's they had smelt the goose, and known it for their own; and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion, these young Cratchits danced about the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while he (not proud, although his collars nearly choked him) blew the fire, until the slow potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to be let out and peeled.",
  "And Martha warn't as late last Christmas Day by half an hour!' 'Here's Martha, mother!' said a girl, appearing as she spoke. 'Here's Martha, mother!' cried the two young Cratchits. ' Hurrah! There's such a goose, Martha!' 'Why , bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!' said Mrs. Cratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet for her with of ficious zeal.",
  "There's father coming,' cried the two young Cratchits, who were everywhere at once. 'Hide, Martha, hide!' So Martha hid herself, and in came little Bob, the father , with at least three feet of comforter , exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him, and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look seasonable, and Tiny Tim upon his shoulder . Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and had his limbs supported by an iron frame!",
  "Martha didn't like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his arms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off into the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper . '",
  "And how did little Tim behave?' asked Mrs. Cratchit when she had rallied Bob on his credulity , and Bob had hugged his daughter to his heart's content. 'As good as gold,' said Bob, 'and better . Somehow , he gets thoughtful, sitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever heard.",
  "He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the church, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon Christmas Day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see.' Bob's voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when he said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty .",
  "His active little crutch was heard upon the floor , and back came Tiny Tim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister to his stool beside the fire; and while Bob, turning up his cuffs—as if, poor fellow , they were capable of being made more shabby—compounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons, and stirred it round and round, and put it on the hob to simmer , Master Peter and the two ubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon returned in high procession.[Pg 81]",
  "Such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of course—and, in truth, it was something very like it in that house. Mrs. Cratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody , not forgetting themselves, and, mounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped.",
  "At last the dishes were set on, and grace was said. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking slowly all along the carving-knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast; but when she did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued forth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried Hurrah!",
  "There never was such a goose. Bob said he didn't believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its tenderness and flavour , size and cheapness, were the themes of universal admiration. Eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said with great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish), they hadn't ate it all at last!",
  "Yet every one had had enough, and the youngest Cratchits, in particular , were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs. Cratchit left the room alone—too nervous to bear witnesses—to take the pudding up, and bring it in. Suppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning out!",
  "Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard and stolen it, while they were merry with the goose—a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid! All sorts of horrors were supposed. Hallo! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper .",
  "A smell like a washing-day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating-house and a pastry-cook 's next door to each other , with a laundress's next door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit entered—flushed, but smiling proudly—with the pudding, like a speckled cannon-ball, so hard and firm, blazing in half of half-a-quartern of ignited brandy , and bedight with Christmas holly stuck into the top.",
  "Oh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since their marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her mind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour . Everybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family .",
  "It would have been flat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing. WITH THE PUDDING At last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth swept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a shovel full of chestnuts on the fire.[Pg 87]",
  "Then all the Cratchit family drew round the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a one; and at Bob Cratchit's elbow stood the family display of glass. Two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle. These held the hot stuff from the jug, however , as well as golden goblets woul d have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily .",
  "Then Bob proposed: 'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!' Which all the family re-echoed. 'God bless us every one!' said Tiny Tim, the last of all. He sat very close to his father's side, upon his little stool. Bob held his withered little hand to his, as if he loved the child, and wished to keep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.",
  "If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future, the child will die.' 'No, no,' said Scrooge. 'Oh no, kind Spirit! say he will be spared.' 'If these shadows remain unaltered by the Future none other of my race,' returned the Ghost, 'will find him here. What then? If he be like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus population.'",
  "Scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the Spirit, and was overcome with penitence and grief. 'Man,' said the Ghost, 'if man you be in heart, not adamant, forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is, and where it is. Will you decide what men shall live, what men shall die?",
  "It may be that, in the sight of Heaven, you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child. O God! to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust!' Scrooge bent before the Ghost's rebuke , and, trembling, cast his eyes upon the ground.",
  "But he raised them speedily on hearing his own name. ' Mr. Scrooge!' said Bob. 'I'll give you Mr . Scrooge, the Founder of the Feast!' 'The Founder of the Feast, indeed!' cried Mrs. Cratchit, reddening. 'I wish I had him here. I'd give him a piece of my mind to feast upon, and I hope he'd have a good appetite for it.'",
  "Christmas Day .' 'It should be Christmas Day, I am sure,' said she, 'on which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy , hard, unfeeling man as Mr . Scrooge. You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it better than you do, poor fellow!' 'My dear!' was Bob's mild answer .",
  "Long life to him! A merry Christmas and a happy New Year! He'll be very merry and very happy , I have no doubt!' The children drank the toast after her. It was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness in it. Tiny Tim drank it last of all, but he didn't care twopence for it.",
  "Scrooge was the Ogre of the family . The mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party , which was not dispelled for full five minutes. After it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before, from the mere relief of Scrooge the Baleful being done with.",
  "Bob Cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for Master Peter , which would bring in, if obtained, full five-and-sixpence weekly . The two young Cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of Peter's being a man of business; and Peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars, as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income.",
  "Martha, who was a poor apprentice at a milliner's, then told them what kind of work she had to do, and how many hours she worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed to-morrow morning for a good long rest; to-morrow being a holiday she passed at home.",
  "Also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before, and how the lord 'was much about as tall as Peter'; at which Peter pulled up his collar so high that you couldn't have seen his head if you had been there. All this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round; and by-and-by they had a song, about a lost child travelling in the snow , from Tiny Tim, who had a plaintive little voice, and sang it very well indeed.",
  "There was nothing of high mark in this. They were not a handsome family; they were not well dressed; their shoes were far from being waterproof; their clothes were scanty; and Peter might have known, and very likely did, the inside of a pawnbroker's. But they were happy , grateful, pleased with one another , and contented with the time; and when they[Pg 89]",
  "By this time it was getting dark, and snowing pretty heavily; and as Scrooge and the Spirit went along the streets, the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens, parlours, and all sorts of rooms was wonderful. Here, the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner , with hot plates baking through and through before the fire, and deep red curtains, ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness.",
  "There, all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters, brothers, cousins, uncles, aunts, and be the first to greet them. Here, again, were shadows on the window-blinds of guests assembling; and there a group of handsome girls, all hooded and fur-booted, and all chattering at once, tripped lightly off to some near neighbour's house; where, woe upon the single man who saw them enter—artful witches, well they knew it—in a glow!",
  "But, if you had judged from the numbe rs of people on their way to friendly gatherings, you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there, instead of every house expecting company , and piling up its fires half-chimney high. Blessings on it, how the Ghost exulted!",
  "How it bared its breadth of breast, and opened its capacious palm, and floated on, outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach! The very lamplighter , who ran on before, dotting the dusky street with specks of light, and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere, laughed out loudly as the Spirit passed, though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but Christmas.",
  "And now, without a word of warning from the Ghost, they stood upon a bleak and desert moor , where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about, as though it were the burial-place of giants; and water spread itself wheresoever it listed; or would have done so, but for the frost that held it prisoner; and nothing grew but moss and furze, and coarse, rank grass.",
  "Down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red, which glared upon the desolation for an instant, like a sullen eye, and frowning lower , lower , lower yet, was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night. 'What place is this?' asked Scrooge. 'A place where miners live, who labour in the bowels of the earth,' returned the Spirit.",
  "See!' A light shone from the window of a hut, and swiftly they advanced towards it. Passing through the wall of mud and stone, they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire. An old, old man and woman, with their children and their children's children, and another generation beyond that, all decked out gaily in their holiday attire.",
  "The old man, in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste, was singing them a Christmas song; it had been a very old song when he was a boy; and from time to time they all joined in the chorus. So surely as they raised their voices, the old man got quite blithe and loud; and so surely as they stopped, his vigour sank again.",
  "The Spirit did not tarry here, but bade Scrooge hold his robe, and, passing on above the moor , sped whither? Not to sea? To sea. To Scrooge's horror , looking back, he saw the last of the land, a fright ful range of rocks, behind them; and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water , as it rolled and roared, and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn, and fiercely tried to undermine the earth.",
  "Built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks , some league or so from shore, on which the waters chafed and dashed, the wild year through, there stood a solitary lighthouse. Great heaps of seaweed clung to its base, and storm-birds—born of the wind, one might suppose, as seaweed of the water—rose and fell about it, like the waves they skimmed.",
  "But, even here, two men who watched the light had made a fire, that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea. Joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat, they wished each other Merry Christmas in their can of grog; and one of them—the elder too, with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather , as the figure-head of an old ship might be—struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself.",
  "Again the Ghost sped on, above the black and heaving sea—on, on—until being far away , as he told Scrooge, from any shore, they lighted on a ship. They stood beside the helmsman at the wheel, the look-out in the bow, the officers who had the watch; dark, ghostly figures in their several stations; but every man among them hummed a Christmas tune, or had a Christmas thought, or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone Christmas Day, with homeward hopes belonging to it.",
  "And every man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder word for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had shared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he cared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember him.",
  "It was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of the wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as profound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus engaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to Scrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a bright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his side, and looking at that same nephew with approving af fability! ' Ha, ha!' laughed Scrooge's nephew . '",
  "If you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed in a laugh than Scrooge's nephew , all I can say is, I should like to know him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance. It is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there is infection in disease and sorrow , there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour .",
  "When Scroog e's nephew laughed in this way—holding his sides, rolling his head, and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions—Scrooge's niece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled friends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily . ' Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!'",
  "He believed it, too!' 'More shame for him, Fred!' said Scrooge's niece indignantly . Bless those women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in earnest. She was very pretty; exceedingly pretty . With a dimpled, surprised-looking, capital face; a ripe little mouth, that seemed made to be kissed—as no doubt it was; all kinds of good little dots about her chin, that melted into one another when she laughed; and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creature's head.",
  "Altogether she was what you would have called provoking, you know; but satisfactory , too. Oh, perfectly satisfactory! ' He's a comical old fellow ,' said Scrooge's nephew , 'that's the truth; and not so pleasant as he might be. However , his offences carry their own punishment, and I have nothing to say against him.'",
  "He don't do any good with it. He don't make himself comfortable with it. He hasn't the satisfaction of thinking—ha, ha, ha!—that he is ever going to benefit Us with it.' 'I have no patience with him,' observed Scrooge's niece. Scrooge's niece's sisters, and all the other ladies, expressed the same opinion. 'Oh, I have!' said Scrooge's nephew .",
  "Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself always. Here he takes it into his head to dislike us, and he won't come and dine with us. What's the consequence? He don't lose much of a dinner .' 'Indeed, I think he loses a very good dinner ,' interrupted Scrooge's niece.",
  "Everybody else said the same, and they must be allowed to have been competent judge s, because they had just had dinner; and with the dessert upon the table, were clustered round the fire, by lamplight. ' Well! I am very glad to hear it,' said Scrooge's nephew , 'because I haven't any great faith in these young housekeepers.",
  "What do you say, Topper?' Topper had clearly got his eye upon one of Scrooge's niece's sisters, for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast, who had no right to express an opinion on the subject. Whereat Scrooge's niece's sister—the plump one with the lace tucker: not the one with the roses—blushed. 'Do go on, Fred,' said Scrooge's niece, clapping her hands.",
  "He is such a ridiculous fellow!' Scrooge's nephew revelled in another laugh, and as it was impossible to keep the infection off, though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar , his example was unanimously followed. 'I was only going to say,' said Scrooge's nephew , 'that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us, and not making merry with us, is, as I think, that he loses some pleasant moments, which could do him no harm.",
  "I am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts, either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers. I mean to give him the same chance every year, whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. He may rail at Christmas till he dies, but he can't help thinking better of it—I defy him—if he finds me going there, in good temper , year after year, and saying, \"Uncle Scrooge, how are you?\"",
  "If it only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds, that's something; and I think I shook him yesterday .' It was their turn to laugh now, at the notion of his shaking Scrooge. But being thoroughly good-natured, and not much caring what they laughed at, so that they laughed at any rate, he encouraged them in their merriment, and passed the bottle, joyously .",
  "After tea they had some music. For they were a musical family , and knew what they were about when they sung a Glee or Catch, I can assure you: especially Topper , who could growl away in the bass like a good one, and never swell the large veins in his forehead, or get red in the face over it.",
  "When this strain of music sounded, all the things that Ghost had shown him came upon his mind; he softened more and more; and thought that if he could have listened to it often, years ago, he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands, without resorting to the sexton's spade that buried Jacob Marley .",
  "The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker! But they didn't devote the whole evening to music. After a while they played at forfeits; for it is good to be children sometimes, and never better than at Christmas, when its mighty Founder was a child himself.",
  "Stop! There was first a game at blind man's-buf f. Of course there was. And I no more believe Topper was really blind than I believe he had eyes in his boots. My opinion is, that it was a done thing between him and Scrooge's nephew; and that the Ghost of Christmas Present knew it.",
  "The way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature. Knocking down the fire-irons, tumbling over the chairs, bumping up against the piano, smothering himself amongst the curtains, wherever she went, there went he! He always knew where the plump sister was.",
  "He wouldn't catch anybody else. If you had fallen up against him (as some of them did) on purpose, he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you, which would have been an affront to your understanding, and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister .",
  "She often cried out that it wasn't fair; and it really was not. But when, at last, he caught her; when, in spite of all her silken rustlings, and her rapid flutterings past him, he got her into a corner whence there was no escape; then his conduct was the most execrable.",
  "For his pretending not to know her; his pretending that it was necessary to touch her head-dress, and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger , and a certain chain about her neck; was vile, monstrous! No doubt she told him her opinion of it when, another blind man being in of fice, they were so very confidential together behind the curtains.",
  "Scrooge's niece was not one of the blind man's-buf f party , but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool, in a snug corner where the Ghost and Scrooge were close behind her. But she joined in the forfeits, and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet.",
  "Likewise at the game of How , When, and Where, she was very great, and, to the secret joy of Scrooge's nephew , beat her sisters hollow; though they were sharp girls too, as Topper could have told you. There might have been twenty people there, young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for wholly[Pg 101]",
  "The Ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood, and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed. But this the Spirit said could not be done. 'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge. 'One half-hour , Spirit, only one!'",
  "It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of something, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their questions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an animal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and lived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show of, and wasn't led by anybody , and didn't live in a menagerie, and was never killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a bull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear.",
  "At every fresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to get up of f the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister , falling into a similar state, cried out: 'I have found it out!",
  "I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!' 'What is it?' cried Fred. 'It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.' Which it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though some objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been 'Yes'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had any tendency that way .",
  "Here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment; and I say , \"Uncle Scrooge!\"' 'Well! Uncle Scrooge!' they cried. 'A merry Christmas and a happy New Year to the old man, whatever he is!' said Scrooge's nephew . 'He wouldn't take it from me, but may he have it, nevertheless.",
  "Uncle Scrooge!' Uncle Scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart, that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return, and thanked them in an inaudible speech, if the Ghost had given him time. But the whole scene passed of f in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew; and he and the Spirit were again upon their travels.",
  "Much they saw, and far they went, and many homes they visited, but always with a happy end. The Spirit stood beside sick-beds, and they were cheerful; on foreign lands, and they were close at home; by struggling men, and they were patient in their greater hope; by poverty , and it was rich. In almshouse, hospital, and gaol, in misery's every refuge, where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door, and barred the Spirit out, he left his blessing and taught Scrooge his precepts.",
  "It was a long night, if it were only a night; but Scrooge had his doubts of this, because the Christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together . It was strange, too, that, while Scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form, the Ghost grew older , clearly older . Scrooge had observed this change, but never spoke of it until they left a children's Twelfth-Night party , when, looking at the Spirit as they stood together in an open place, he noticed that its hair was grey . 'Are spirits' lives so short?' asked Scrooge. '",
  "My life upon this globe is very brief,' replied the Ghost. 'It ends to-night.' 'To-night!' cried Scrooge. 'To-night at midnight. Hark! The time is drawing near .' The chimes were ringing the three-quarters past eleven at that moment. 'Forgive me if I am not justified in what I ask,' said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, 'but I see something strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts.",
  "Is it a foot or a claw?' 'It might be a claw , for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's sorrowful reply . 'Look here!' From the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject, frightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung upon the outside of its garment.[Pg 103]",
  "Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost. They were a boy and girl. Yellow , meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but prostrate, too, in their humility . Where graceful youth should have filled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds.",
  "Where angels might have sat enthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no degradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the mysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and dread. Scrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he tried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves, rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude. 'Spirit!",
  "Scrooge could say no more. 'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they cling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This girl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of all beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom, unless the writing be erased.",
  "Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out his hand towards the city . ' Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for your factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!' 'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge. 'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last time with his own words.",
  "The bell struck Twelve. Scrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last stroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob Marley , and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and hooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.",
  "THE LAST OF THE SPIRITS The Phantom slowly , gravely , silently approached. When it came near him, Scrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this Spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery . It was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its face, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched hand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded.",
  "He felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more, for the Spirit neither spoke nor moved. 'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said Scrooge.",
  "The Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand. 'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened, but will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so, Spirit?' The upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its folds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head.",
  "That was the only answer he received. Although well used to ghostly compan y by this time, Scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit paused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to recover .",
  "But Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague, uncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his own to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black.",
  "But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope to live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your company , and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?' It gave him no reply .",
  "The hand was pointed straight before them. 'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is precious time to me, I know . Lead on, Spirit!' The Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in the shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him along.",
  "They scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to spring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they were in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried up and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in groups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.",
  "The Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing that the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their talk. ' No,' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, 'I don't know much about it either way . I only know he's dead.'",
  "Suppose we make up a party , and volunteer?' 'I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,' observed the gentleman with the excrescence on his nose. 'But I must be fed if I make one.' Another laugh. \"How are you?\" said one. \"How are you?\" returned the other .",
  "But I'll offer to go if anybody else will. When I come to think of it, I'm not at all sure that I wasn't his most particular friend; for we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Bye, bye!' Speakers and listeners strolled away , and mixed with other groups.",
  "Scrooge knew the men, and looked towards the Spirit for an explanation. The phantom glided on into a street. Its finger pointed to two persons meeting. Scrooge listened again, thinking that the explanation might lie here. He knew these men, also, perfectly . They were men of business: very wealthy , and of great importance.",
  "He had made a point always of standing well in their esteem in a business point of view , that is; strictly in a business point of view . 'How are you?' said one. 'How are you?' returned the other . 'Well!' said the first, 'old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?'[Pg 115]",
  "You are not a skater , I suppose?' 'No, no. Something else to think of. Good-morning!' Not another word. That was their meeting, their conversation, and their parting. Scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the Spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial; but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose, he set himself to consider what it was likely to be.",
  "They could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of Jacob, his old partner , for that was Past, and this Ghost's province was the Future. Nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them. But nothing doubting that, to whomsoever they applied, they had some latent moral for his own improvement, he resolved to treasure up every word he heard, and everything he saw; and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared.",
  "For he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed, and would render the solution of these riddles easy . He looked about in that very place for his own image, but another man stood in his accustomed corner; and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there, he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the Porch.",
  "It gave him little surprise, however; for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life, and thought and hoped he saw his new-born resolutions carried out in this. Quiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched hand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied, from the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself, that the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly .",
  "It made him shudder , and feel very cold. They left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town, where Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its situation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop and houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly. Alleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgor ged their offences of smell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole quarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery .",
  "Far in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling shop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and greasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse iron of all kinds.",
  "Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and sepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a charcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly seventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without by a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.",
  "Scrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely entered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was closely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other .",
  "After a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with the pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh. 'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered first. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the undertaker's man alone to be the third.",
  "Look here, old Joe, here's a chance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!' 'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his pipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour . You were made free of it long ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers.",
  "Stop till I shut the door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no such old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling, we're well matched.",
  "Come into the parlour . Come into the parlour .' The parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked the fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky lamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth again.",
  "While he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor , and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her elbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two. 'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman.",
  "Who's the wiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?' 'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together . 'We should hope not.' 'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?' 'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber , laughing.",
  "If he had been, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.' 'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber . 'It's a judgment on him.' 'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it should have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands on anything else.",
  "Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value of it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for them to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.'",
  "But the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this; and the man in faded black, mounting the breach first, produced his plunder . It was not extensive. A seal or two, a pencil-case, a pair of sleeve-bu ttons, and a brooch of no great value, were all. They were severally examined and appraised by old Joe, who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each upon the wall, and added them up into a total when he found that there was nothing more to come.",
  "Who's next?' \"What do you call this?\" said Joe. \"Bed-curtains.\" Mrs. Dilber was next. Sheets and towels, a little wearing apparel, two old fashioned silver teaspoons, a pair of sugar - tongs, and a few boots. Her account was stated on the wall in the same manner .[Pg 120] [Pg 121]",
  "It's a weakness of mine, and that's the way I ruin myself,' said old Joe. 'That's your account. If you asked me for another penny , and made it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal, and knock off half-a-crown.' 'And now undo my bundle, Joe,' said the first woman.",
  "Joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it, and, having unfastened a great many knots, dragged out a lar ge heavy roll of some dark stuf f. 'What do you call this?' said Joe. 'Bed-curtains?' 'Ah!' returned the woman, laughing and leaning forward on her crossed arms.",
  "Yes, I do,' replied the woman. 'Why not?' 'You were born to make your fortune,' said Joe, 'and you'll certainly do it.' 'I certainly shan't hold my hand, when I can get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a man as he was, I promise you, Joe,' returned the woman coolly .",
  "Eh?' said old Joe, stopping in his work, and looking up. 'Don't you be afraid of that,' returned the woman. 'I an't so fond of his company that I'd loiter about him for such things, if he did. Ah! you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache, but you won't find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place.",
  "It's the best he had, and a fine one too. They'd have wasted it, if it hadn't been for me.' 'What do you call wasting of it?' asked old Joe. 'Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure,' replied the woman, with a laugh. 'Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again.",
  "If calico an't good enough for such a purpose, it isn't good enough for anything. It's quite as becoming to the body . He can't look uglier than he did in that one.' Scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror . As they sat grouped about their spoil, in the scanty light afforded by the old man's lamp, he viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater , though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself.",
  "Ha, ha!' laughed the same woman when old Joe producing a flannel bag with money in it, told out their several gains upon the ground. 'This is the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead!",
  "Ha, ha, ha!' 'Spirit!' said Scrooge, shuddering from head to foot. 'I see, I see. The case of this unhappy man might be my own. My life tends that way now . Merciful heaven, what is this?' He recoiled in terror , for the scene had changed, and now he almost touched a bed—a bare, uncurtained bed—on which, beneath a ragged sheet, there lay a something covered up, which, though it was dumb, announced itself in awful language.",
  "The room was very dark, too dark to be observed with any accuracy , though Scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse, anxious to know what kind of room it was. A pale light, rising in the outer air, fell straight upon the bed; and on it, plundered and bereft, unwatched, unwept, uncared for , was the body of this man.",
  "Scrooge glanced towards the Phantom. Its steady hand was pointed to the head. The cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it, the motion of a finger upon Scrooge's part, would have disclosed the face. He thought of it, felt how easy it would be to do, and longed to do it; but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side.",
  "Oh, cold, cold, rigid, dreadful Death, set up thine altar here, and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command; for this is thy dominion! But of the loved, revered, and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes, or make one feature odious.",
  "It is not that the hand is heavy , and will fall down when released; it is not that the heart and pulse are still; but that the hand was open, generous, and true; the heart brave, warm, and tender , and the pulse a man's. Strike, Shadow , strike!",
  "No voice pronounced these words in Scrooge's ears, and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed. He thought, if this man could be raised up now, what would be his foremost thoughts? Avarice, hard dealing, griping cares? They have brought him to a rich end, truly! He lay in the dark, empty house, with not a man, a woman, or a child to say he was kind to me in this or that, and for the memory of one kind word I will be kind to him.",
  "A cat was tearing at the door, and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone. What they wanted in the room of death, and why they were so restless and disturbed, Scrooge did not dare to think. 'Spirit!' he said, 'this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its lesson, trust me.",
  "Let us go!' Still the Ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head. 'I understand you,' Scrooge returned, 'and I would do it if I could. But I have not the power , Spirit. I have not the power .' Again it seemed to look upon him. 'If there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this man's death,' said Scrooge, quite agonised, 'show that person to me, Spirit, I beseech you!'",
  "The Phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment, like a wing; and, withdrawing it, revealed a room by daylight, where a mother and her children were. She was expecting some one, and with anxious eagerness; for she walked up and down the room, started at every sound, looked out from the window , glanced at the clock, tried, but in vain, to work with her needle, and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play .",
  "At length the long-expected knock was heard. She hurried to the door, and met her husband; a man whose face was careworn and depressed, though he was young. There was a remarkable expression in it now, a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed, and which he struggled to repress.",
  "He sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire, and when she asked him faintly what news (which was not until after a long silence), he appeared embarrassed how to answer . 'Is it good,' she said, 'or bad?' to help him. 'Bad,' he answered.",
  "Nothing is past hope, if such a miracle has happened.' 'He is past relenting,' said her husband. 'He is dead.' She was a mild and patient creature, if her face spoke truth; but she was thankful in her soul to hear it, and she said so with clasped hands. She prayed for giveness the next moment, and was sorry; but the first was the emotion of her heart.",
  "He was not only very ill, but dying, then.' 'To whom will our debt be transferred?' 'I don't know . But, before that time, we shall be ready with the money; and even though we were not, it would be bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor .",
  "We may sleep to-night with light hearts, Caroline!' Yes. Soften it as they would, their hearts were lighter . The children's faces, hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood, were brighter; and it was a happier house for this man's death! The only emotion that the Ghost could show him, caused by the event, was one of pleasure.",
  "The Ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet; and as they went along, Scrooge looked here and there to find himself, but nowhere was he to be seen. They entered poor Bob Cratchit's house; the dwelling he had visited before; and found the mother and the children seated round the fire.[Pg 125]",
  "Quiet. Very quiet. The noisy little Cratchits were as still as statues in one corner , and sat looking up at Peter , who had a book before him. The mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing. But surely they were very quiet! ' \"And he took a child, and set him in the midst of them.",
  "He had not dreamed them. The boy must have read them out as he and the Spirit crossed the threshold. Why did he not go on? The mother laid her work upon the table, and put her hand up to her face. ' The colour hurts my eyes,' she said.",
  "The colour? Ah, poor Tiny Tim! ' They're better now again,' said Cratchit's wife. 'It makes them weak by candle-light; and I wouldn't show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world. It must be near his time.' 'Past it rather ,' Peter answered, shutting up his book. '",
  "But I think he has walked a little slower than he used, these few last evenings, mother .' They were very quiet again. At last she said, and in a steady , cheerful voice, that only faltered once: 'I have known him walk with—I have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder very fast indeed.'",
  "So had all. ' But he was very light to carry ,' she resumed, intent upon her work, 'and his fathe r loved him so, that it was no trouble, no trouble. And there is your father at the door!' She hurried out to meet him; and little Bob in his comforter—he had need of it, poor fellow—came in.",
  "His tea was ready for him on the hob, and they all tried who should help him to it most. Then the two young Cratchits got upon his knees, and laid, each child, a little cheek against his face, as if they said, 'Don't mind it, father . Don't be grieved!'",
  "Bob was very cheerful with them, and spoke pleasantly to all the family . He looked at the work upon the table, and praised the industry and speed of Mrs. Cratchit and the girls. They would be done long before Sunday , he said. ' Sunday! You went to-day , then, Robert?' said his wife. '",
  "Yes, my dear,' returned Bob. 'I wish you could have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a place it is. But you'll see it often. I promised him that I would walk there on a Sunday . My little, little child!' cried Bob. 'My little child!'",
  "He broke down all at once. He couldn't help it. If he could have helped it, he and his child would have been farther apart, perhaps, than they were. He left the room, and went upstairs into the room above, which was lighted cheerfully , and hung with Christmas. There was a chair set close beside the child, and there were signs of some one having been there lately .",
  "Poor Bob sat down in it, and when he had thought a little and composed himself, he kissed the little face. He was reconciled to what had happened, and went down again quite happy . They drew about the fire, and talked, the girls and mother working still. Bob told them of the extra ordinary kindness of Mr. Scrooge's nephew , whom he had scarcely seen but once, and who, meeting him in the street that day, and seeing that he looked a little—'just a little down, you know ,' said Bob, inquired what had happened to distress him. 'On which,' said Bob, 'for he is the pleasantest-spoken gentleman you ever heard, I told him.",
  "By-the-bye, how he ever knew that I don't know .' 'Knew what, my dear?' 'Why , that you were a good wife,' replied Bob. 'Everybody knows that,' said Peter . 'Very well observed, my boy!' cried Bob. 'I hope they do. \"Heartily sorry ,\" he said, \"for your good wife.",
  "If I can be of service to you in any way,\" he said, giving me his card, \"that's where I live. Pray come to me.\" Now , it wasn't,' cried Bob, 'for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us, so much as for his kind way, that this was quite delightful.",
  "I shouldn't be at all surprised—mark what I say!—if he got Peter a better situation.' 'Only hear that, Peter ,' said Mrs. Cratchit. 'And then,' cried one of the girls, 'Peter will be keeping company with some one, and setting up for himself.' 'Get along with you!' retorted Peter , grinning.",
  "But, however and whenever we part from one another , I am sure we shall none of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we—or this first parting that there was among us?' 'Never , father!' cried they all. 'And I know ,' said Bob, 'I know , my dears, that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was; although he was a little, little child; we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and for get poor Tiny Tim in doing it.'",
  "Mrs. Cratchit kissed him, his daughters kissed him, the two young Cratchits kissed him, and Peter and himself shook hands. Spirit of Tiny Tim, thy childish essence was from God! ' Spectre,' said Scrooge, 'something informs me that our parting moment is at hand. I know it but I know not how.",
  "Tell me what man that was whom we saw lying dead?' The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come conveyed him, as before—though at a different time, he thought: indeed there seemed no order in these latter visions, save that they were in the Future—into the resorts of business men, but showed him not himself.",
  "Indeed, the Spirit did not stay for anything, but went straight on, as to the end just now desired, until besought by Scrooge to tarry for a moment. 'This court,' said Scrooge, 'through which we hurry now, is where my place of occupation is, and has been for a length of time.",
  "I see the house. Let me behold what I shall be in days to come.' The Spirit stopped; the hand was pointed elsewhere. 'The house is yonder ,' Scrooge exclaimed. 'Why do you point away?' The inexorable finger underwent no change. Scrooge hastened to the window of his office, and looked in.",
  "It was an office still, but not his. The furniture was not the same, and the figure in the chair was not himself. The Phantom pointed as before. He joined it once again, and, wondering why and whither he had gone, accompanied it until they reached an iron gate. He paused to look round before entering.",
  "A churchyard. Here, then, the wretched man, whose name he had now to learn, lay underneath the ground. It was a worthy place. Walled in by houses; overrun by grass and weeds, the growth of vegetation's death, not life; choked up with too much burying; fat with repleted appetite. A worthy place!",
  "The Spirit stood among the graves, and pointed down to One. He advanced towards it trembling. The Phantom was exactly as it had been, but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape. ' Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you point,' said Scrooge, 'answer me one question.",
  "Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of the things that May be only?' Still the Ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood. 'Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead,' said Scrooge. 'But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change.",
  "Say it is thus with what you show me!' The Spirit was immovable as ever . Scrooge crept towards it, trembling as he went; and, following the finger , read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name, Ebenezer Scrooge . ' Am I that man who lay upon the bed?'",
  "Oh no, no!' The finger still was there. 'Spirit!' he cried, tight clutching at its robe, 'hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man I must have been but for this intercourse. Why show me this, if I am past all hope?' For the first time the hand appeared to shake.",
  "Assure me that I yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life?' The kind hand trembled. 'I will honour Christmas in my heart, and try to keep it all the year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me.",
  "I will not shut out the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me I may sponge away the writing on this stone!' In his agony he caught the spectral hand. It sought to free itself, but he was strong in his entreaty , and detained it. The Spirit stronger yet, repulsed him.",
  "THE END OF IT Yes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his own. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own, to make amends in! 'I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!' Scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed. '",
  "The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. O Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be praised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!' He was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call.",
  "He had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with tears. 'They are not torn down,' cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed-curtains in his arms, 'They are not torn down, rings and all. They are here—I am here—the shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled.",
  "They will be. I know they will!' His hands were busy with his garments all this time: turning them inside out, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making them parties to every kind of extravagance. 'I don't know what to do!' cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the same breath, and making a perfect Laocoon of himself with his stockings.",
  "A merry Christmas to everybody! A happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!' He had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there, perfectly winded. 'There's the saucepan that the gruel was in!' cried Scrooge, starting off again, and going round the fireplace. 'There's the door by which the Ghost of Jacob Marley entered!",
  "Really , for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was a splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long line of brilliant laughs! 'I don't know what day of the month it is,' said Scrooge. 'I don't know how long I have been among the Spirits.",
  "I don't know anything. I'm quite a baby . Never mind. I don't care. I'd rather be a baby . Hallo! Whoop! Hallo here!' He was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard. Clash, clash, hammer; ding, dong, bell! Bell, dong, ding; hammer , clash, clash!",
  "Oh, glorious, glorious! Running to the window , he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no mist; clear , bright, jovial, stirring, cold; cold, piping for the blood to dance to; golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry bells. Oh, glorious! Glorious! 'What's to-day?' cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.",
  "The Spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!' 'Hallo!' returned the boy . 'Do you know the poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?' Scrooge inquired. 'I should hope I did,' replied the lad.",
  "Do you know whethe r they've sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?—Not the little prize turkey: the big one?' 'What! the one as big as me?' returned the boy . 'What a delightful boy!' said Scrooge. 'It's a pleasure to talk to him. Yes, my buck!' 'It's hanging there now ,' replied the boy .",
  "No, no,' said Scrooge. 'I am in earnest. Go and buy it, and tell 'em to bring it here, that I may give them the directions where to take it. Come back with the man, and I'll give you a shilling. Come back with him in less than five minutes, and I'll give you half-a-crown!'",
  "The boy was of f like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at a trigger who could have got a shot of f half as fast. 'I'll send it to Bob Cratchit's,' whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands, and splitting with a laugh. 'He shan't know who sends it.",
  "It's twice the size of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to Bob's will be!' The hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one; but write it he did, somehow , and went downstairs to open the street-door , ready for the coming of the poulterer's man.",
  "As he stood there, waiting his arrival, the knocker caught his eye. 'I shall love it as long as I live!' cried Scrooge, patting it with his hand. 'I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it has in its face! It's a wonderful knocker!—Here's the turkey .",
  "Hallo! Whoop! How are you! Merry Christmas!' It was a turkey! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird. He would have snapped 'em short off in a minute, like sticks of sealing-wax. 'Why , it's impossible to carry that to Camden Town,' said Scrooge. 'Y ou must have a cab.'",
  "The chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey , and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again, and chuckled till he cried.",
  "Shaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much; and shaving requires attention, even when you don't dance while you are at it. But if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a piece of sticking-plaster[Pg 140] [Pg 141] [Pg 142]",
  "He dressed himself 'all in his best,' and at last got out into the streets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them with the Ghost of Christm as Present; and, walking with his hands behind him, Scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile.",
  "He looked so irresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured fellows said, 'Good-morning, sir! A merry Christmas to you!' And Scrooge said often afterwards that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard, those were the blithest in his ears. He had not gone far when, coming on towards him, he beheld the portly gentl eman who had walked into his counting- house the day before, and said, 'Scrooge and Marley's, I believe?'",
  "It sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met; but he knew what path lay straight before him, and he took it. ' My dear sir,' said Scrooge, quickening his pace, and taking the old gentleman by both his hands, 'how do you do?",
  "I hope you succeeded yesterday . It was very kind of you. A merry Christmas to you, sir!' 'Mr. Scrooge?' 'Yes,' said Scrooge. 'That is my name, and I fear it may not be pleasant to you. Allow me to ask your pardon. And will you have the goodness——' Here Scrooge whispered in his ear .",
  "My dear Mr . Scrooge, are you serious?' 'If you please,' said Scrooge. 'Not a farthing less. A great many back-payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do me that favour?' 'My dear sir ,' said the other , shaking hands with him, 'I don't know what to say to such munifi——' 'Don't say anything, please,' retorted Scrooge.",
  "Will you come and see me?' 'I will!' cried the old gentleman. And it was clear he meant to do it. ' Thankee,' said Scrooge. 'I am much obliged to you. I thank you fifty times. Bless you!' He went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people hurry ing to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned beggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses, and up to the windows; and found that everything could yield him pleasure.",
  "He had never dreamed that any walk—that anything—could give him so much happiness. In the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephew's house. He passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and knock. But he made a dash and did it. 'Is your master at home, my dear?' said Scrooge to the girl.",
  "Very.' 'Yes, sir .' 'Where is he, my love?' said Scrooge. 'He's in the dining-room, sir , along with mistress. I'll show you upstairs, if you please.' 'Thankee. He knows me,' said Scrooge, with his hand already on the dining-room lock. 'I'll go in here, my dear .' He turned it gently , and sidled his face in round the door.",
  "They were looking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see that everything is right. 'Fred!' said Scrooge. Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage started! Scrooge had forgotten, for the moment, about her sitting in the corner with the footstool, or he wouldn't have done it on any account.",
  "I have come to dinner . Will you let me in, Fred?\" 'It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner . Will you let me in, Fred?' Let him in! It is a mercy he didn't shake his arm off. He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could be heartier .",
  "His niece looked just the same. So did Topper when he came. So did the plump sister when she came. So did every one when they came. Wonderful party , wonderful games, wonderful unanimity , won-der -ful happiness! But he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there!",
  "If he could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That was the thing he had set his heart upon. And he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter past. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.",
  "Scrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the tank. His hat was off before he opened the door; his comforter too. He was on his stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying to overtake nine o'clock. '",
  "Hallo!' growled Scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could feign it. 'What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?' 'I am very sorry , sir,' said Bob. 'I am behind my time.' 'You are!' repeated Scrooge. ' Y es, I think you are.",
  "Step this way , sir, if you please.' 'It's only once a year, sir,' pleaded Bob, appearing from the tank. 'It shall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday , sir.' 'Now , I'll tell you what, my friend,' said Scrooge. 'I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer .",
  "Bob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary idea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the people in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat. 'A merry Christmas, Bob!' said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. 'A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow , than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise your salary , and endeavour to assist your struggling family , and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob!",
  "Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!' \"Now , I'll tell you what, my friend,\" said Scrooge. \"I am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer .\" Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father .",
  "He became as good a friend, as good a master , and as good a man as the good old City knew , or any other good old city, town, or borough in the good old world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway , he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for him.",
  "He had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total-Abstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us! And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One![Pg 147]",

  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral THE ÆSOP FOR CHILDREN 1. THE WOLF AND THE KID There was once a little Kid whose growing horns made him think he was a grown-up Billy Goat and able to take care of himself. So one evening when the fock started home from the pasture and his mother called, the Kid paid no heed and kept right on nibbling the tender grass.",
  "A little later when he lifted his head, the fock was gone. He was all alone. The sun was sinking. Long shadows came creeping over the ground. A chilly little wind came creeping with them making scary noises in the grass. The Kid shivered as he thought of the terrible Wolf.",
  "Then he started wildly over the feld, bleating for his mother. But not half-way, near a clump of trees, there was the Wolf! The Kid knew there was little hope for him. \"Please, Mr. Wolf,\" he said trembling, \"I know you are going to eat me. But frst please pipe me a tune, for I want to dance and be merry as long as I can.\"",
  "The Wolf liked the idea of a little music before eating, so he struck up a merry tune and the Kid leaped and frisked gaily. Meanwhile, the fock was moving slowly homeward. In the still evening air the Wolf's piping carried far. The Shepherd Dogs pricked up their ears. They recognized the song the Wolf sings before a feast, and in a moment they were racing back to the pasture. The Wolf's song ended suddenly, and as he ran, with the Dogs at his heels, he called himself a fool for turning piper to please a Kid, when he should have stuck to his butcher's trade.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 2. THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS The Tortoise, you know, carries his house on his back. No matter how hard he tries, he cannot leave home. They say that Jupiter punished him so, because he was such a lazy stay-at-home that he would not go to Jupiter's wedding, even when especially invited.",
  "After many years, Tortoise began to wish he had gone to that wedding. When he saw how gaily the birds few about and how the Hare and the Chipmunk and all the other animals ran nimbly by, always eager to see everything there was to be seen, the Tortoise felt very sad and discontented.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral One day he met a pair of Ducks and told them all his trouble. \"We can help you to see the world,\" said the Ducks. \"Take hold of this stick with your teeth and we will carry you far up in the air where you can see the whole countryside.",
  "But keep quiet or you will be sorry.\" The Tortoise was very glad indeed. He seized the stick frmly with his teeth, the two Ducks took hold of it one at each end, and away they sailed up toward the clouds. Just then a Crow few by. He was very much astonished at the strange sight and cried: \"This must surely be the King of Tortoises!\" \"Why certainly——\" began the Tortoise.",

  "But she could walk sideways only, like her son. And when she wanted to turn her toes out she tripped and fell on her nose. Moral: Do not tell others how to act unless you can set a good example. 4. THE FROGS AND THE OX An Ox came down to a reedy pool to drink.",

  "The Frog puffed up still more. \"He could not have been bigger than this,\" she said. But the little Frogs all declared that the monster was much, much bigger and the old Frog kept puffng herself out more and more until, all at once, she burst. Moral: Do not attempt the impossible.",
  "THE DOG, THE COCK, AND THE FOX A Dog and a Cock, who were the best of friends, wished very much to see something of the world. So they decided to leave the farmyard and to set out into the world along the road that led to the woods. The two comrades traveled along in the very best of spirits and without meeting any adventure to speak of.",
  "At nightfall the Cock, looking for a place to roost, as was his custom, spied nearby a hollow tree that he thought would do very nicely for a night's lodging. The Dog could creep inside and the Cock would fy up on one of the branches. So said, so done, and both slept very comfortably.",
  "With the frst glimmer of dawn the Cock awoke. For the moment he forgot just where he was. He thought he was still in the farmyard where it had been his duty to arouse the household at daybreak. So standing on tip- toes he fapped his wings and crowed lustily.",
  "But instead of awakening the farmer, he awakened a Fox not far off in the wood. The Fox immediately had rosy visions of a very delicious breakfast. Hurrying to the tree where the Cock was roosting, he said very politely: \"A hearty welcome to our woods, honoured sir. I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you here.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral \"I feel highly fattered, kind sir,\" replied the Cock slyly. \"If you will please go around to the door of my house at the foot of the tree, my porter will let you in.\" The hungry but unsuspecting Fox, went around the tree as he was told, and in a twinkling the Dog had seized him.",
  "Moral: Those who try to deceive may expect to be paid in their own coin. 6. BELLING THE CAT The Mice once called a meeting to decide on a plan to free themselves of their enemy, the Cat. At least they wished to fnd some way of knowing when she was coming, so they might have time to run away.",
  "Indeed, something had to be done, for they lived in such constant fear of her claws that they hardly dared stir from their dens by night or day. Many plans were discussed, but none of them was thought good enough. At last a very young Mouse got up and said: \"I have a plan that seems very simple, but I know it will be successful.",
  "All we have to do is to hang a bell about the Cat's neck. When we hear the bell ringing we will know immediately that our enemy is coming.\" All the Mice were much surprised that they had not thought of such a plan before. But in the midst of the rejoicing over their good fortune, an old Mouse arose and said: \"I will say that the plan of the young Mouse is very good.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral Who will bell the Cat?\" Moral: It is one thing to say that something should be done, but quite a different matter to do it. 7. THE EAGLE AND THE JACKDAW An Eagle, swooping down on powerful wings, seized a lamb in her talons and made off with it to her nest. A Jackdaw saw the deed, and his silly head was flled with the idea that he was big and strong enough to do as the Eagle had done. So with much rustling of feathers and a ferce air, he came down swiftly on the back of a large Ram.",
  "But when he tried to rise again he found that he could not get away, for his claws were tangled in the wool. And so far was he from carrying away the Ram, that the Ram hardly noticed he was there. The Shepherd saw the futtering Jackdaw and at once guessed what had happened.",
  "Running up, he caught the bird and clipped its wings. That evening he gave the Jackdaw to his children. \"What a funny bird this is!\" they said laughing, \"what do you call it, father?\" \"That is a Jackdaw, my children. But if you should ask him, he would say he is an Eagle.\"",
  "Moral: Do not let your vanity make you overestimate your powers. 8. THE BOY AND THE FILBERTS A Boy was given permission to put his hand into a pitcher to get some flberts. But he took such a great fstful that he could not draw his hand out again. There he stood, Free eBook from https://www.freekidsbooks.org Page 18",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral unwilling to give up a single flbert and yet unable to get them all out at once. Vexed and disappointed he began to cry. \"My boy,\" said his mother, \"be satisfed with half the nuts you have taken and you will easily get your hand out.",
  "Then perhaps you may have some more flberts some other time.\" Moral: Do not attempt too much at once. 9. HERCULES AND THE WAGONER A Farmer was driving his wagon along a miry country road after a heavy rain. The horses could hardly drag the load through the deep mud, and at last came to a standstill when one of the wheels sank to the hub in a rut.",
  "The farmer climbed down from his seat and stood beside the wagon looking at it but without making the least effort to get it out of the rut. All he did was to curse his bad luck and call loudly on Hercules to come to his aid. Then, it is said, Hercules really did appear, saying: \"Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and urge on your horses.",
  "Do you think you can move the wagon by simply looking at it and whining about it? Hercules will not help unless you make some effort to help yourself.\" And when the farmer put his shoulder to the wheel and urged on the horses, the wagon moved very readily, and soon the Farmer was riding along in great content and with a good lesson learned.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 10. THE KID AND THE WOLF A frisky young Kid had been left by the herdsman on the thatched roof of a sheep shelter to keep him out of harm's way. The Kid was browsing near the edge of the roof, when he spied a Wolf and began to jeer at him, making faces and abusing him to his heart's content.",
  "When you are up there it is the roof that's talking, not you.\" Moral: Do not say anything at any time that you would not say at all times. 11. THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE A Town Mouse once visited a relative who lived in the country. For lunch the Country Mouse served wheat stalks, roots, and acorns, with a dash of cold water for drink.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral After the meal the friends had a long talk, or rather the Town Mouse talked about her life in the city while the Country Mouse listened. They then went to bed in a cozy nest in the hedgerow and slept in quiet and comfort until morning.",
  "In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.

  "The Birds peeped out, and Dr. Cat, with much solicitude, asked how they were. He would be very happy to give them some medicine. \"Tweet, tweet,\" laughed the Birds. \"Very smart, aren't you? We are very well, thank you, and more so, if you only keep away from here.\" Moral: Be wise and shun the quack.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 88. THE DOG AND THE OYSTER There was once a Dog who was very fond of eggs. He visited the hen house very often and at last got so greedy that he would swallow the eggs whole. One day the Dog wandered down to the seashore.",

  "THE ASTROLOGER A man who lived a long time ago believed that he could read the future in the stars. He called himself an Astrologer, and spent his time at night gazing at the sky. One evening he was walking along the open road outside the village. His eyes were fxed on the stars.",
  "He thought he saw there that the end of the world was at hand, when all at once, down he went into a hole full of mud and water. There he stood up to his ears, in the muddy water, and madly clawing at the slippery sides of the hole in his effort to climb out.",
  "His cries for help soon brought the villagers running. As they pulled him out of the mud, one of them said: \"You pretend to read the future in the stars, and yet you fail to see what is at your feet! This may teach you to pay more attention to what is right in front of you, and let the future take care of itself.\"",

  "The Lion had little hope of eating them, for he was no match for three strong Bullocks with their sharp horns and hoofs. But he could not keep away from that feld, for it is hard to resist watching a good meal, even when there is little chance of getting it.",
  "Then one day the Bullocks had a quarrel, and when the hungry Lion came to look at them and lick his chops as he was accustomed to do, he found them in separate corners of the feld, as far away from one another as they could get. It was now an easy matter for the Lion to attack them one at a time, and this he proceeded to do with the greatest satisfaction and relish.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 91. MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN A poor Woodman was cutting down a tree near the edge of a deep pool in the forest. It was late in the day and the Woodman was tired. He had been working since sunrise and his strokes were not so sure as they had been early that morning.",
  "Thus it happened that the axe slipped and few out of his hands into the pool. The Woodman was in despair. The axe was all he possessed with which to make a living, and he had not money enough to buy a new one. As he stood wringing his hands and weeping, the god Mercury suddenly appeared and asked what the trouble was. The Woodman told what had happened, and straightway the kind Mercury dived into the pool.",
  "When he came up again he held a wonderful golden axe. \"Is this your axe?\" Mercury asked the Woodman. \"No,\" answered the honest Woodman, \"that is not my axe.\" Mercury laid the golden axe on the bank and sprang back into the pool. This time he brought up an axe of silver, but the Woodman declared again that his axe was just an ordinary one with a wooden handle.",
  "Mercury dived down for the third time, and when he came up again he had the very axe that had been lost. The poor Woodman was very glad that his axe had been found and could not thank the kind god enough. Mercury was greatly pleased with the Woodman's honesty.",
  "The happy Woodman returned to his home with his treasures, and soon the story of his good fortune was known to everybody in the village. Now there were several Woodmen in the village who believed that they could easily win the same good fortune. They hurried out into the woods, one here, one there, and hiding their axes in the bushes, pretended they had lost them.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral And indeed, Mercury did appear, frst to this one, then to that. To each one he showed an axe of gold, and each one eagerly claimed it to be the one he had lost. But Mercury did not give them the golden axe.",
  "Oh no! Instead he gave them each a hard whack over the head with it and sent them home. And when they returned next day to look for their own axes, they were nowhere to be found. Moral: Honesty is the best policy. 92. THE FROG AND THE MOUSE A young Mouse in search of adventure was running along the bank of a pond where lived a Frog. When the Frog saw the Mouse, he swam to the bank and croaked: \"Won't you pay me a visit?",
  "I can promise you a good time if you do.\" The Mouse did not need much coaxing, for he was very anxious to see the world and everything in it. But though he could swim a little, he did not dare risk going into the pond without some help. The Frog had a plan.",
  "He tied the Mouse's leg to his own with a tough reed. Then into the pond he jumped, dragging his foolish companion with him. The Mouse soon had enough of it and wanted to return to shore; but the treacherous Frog had other plans. He pulled the Mouse down under the water and drowned him. But before he could untie the reed that bound him to the dead Mouse, a Hawk came sailing over the pond. Seeing the body of the Mouse foating on the water, the Hawk swooped down, seized the Mouse and carried it off, with the Frog dangling from its leg.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 93. THE FOX AND THE CRAB A Crab one day grew disgusted with the sands in which he lived. He decided to take a stroll to the meadow not far inland. There he would fnd better fare than briny water and sand mites.",

  "Far into the sky he soared trying to shake off his enemy. But the Serpent's hold only tightened, and slowly the Eagle sank back to earth, gasping for breath. A Countryman chanced to see the unequal combat. In pity for the noble Eagle he rushed up and soon had loosened the coiling Serpent and freed the Eagle.",
  "The Serpent was furious. He had no chance to bite the watchful Countryman. Instead he struck at the drinking horn, hanging at the Countryman's belt, and into it let fy the poison of his fangs. The Countryman now went on toward home. Becoming thirsty on the way, he flled his horn at a spring, and was about to drink.",
  "There was a sudden rush of great wings. Sweeping down, the Eagle seized the poisoned horn from out his saviour's hands, and few away with it to hide it where it could never be found. Moral: An act of kindness is well repaid. 95. THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING A certain Wolf could not get enough to eat because of the watchfulness of the Shepherds.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral Soon a little Lamb was following him about and was quickly led away to slaughter. That evening the Wolf entered the fold with the fock. But it happened that the Shepherd took a fancy for mutton broth that very evening, and, picking up a knife, went to the fold.",
  "There the frst he laid hands on and killed was the Wolf. Moral: The evil doer often comes to harm through his own deceit. 96. THE BULL AND THE GOAT A Bull once escaped from a Lion by entering a cave which the Goatherds used to house their focks in stormy weather and at night. It happened that one of the Goats had been left behind, and the Bull had no sooner got inside than this Goat lowered his head and made a rush at him, butting him with his horns.

Furious at the disrespect shown her, the Beetle few to the Eagle's nest and rolled out the eggs.",
  "Not one did she spare. The Eagle's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know. Next year the Eagle built her nest far up on a mountain crag; but the Beetle found it and again destroyed the eggs. In despair the Eagle now implored great Jupiter to let her place her eggs in his lap.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral lap. Now the Beetle told the reason for her action, and Jupiter had to acknowledge the justice of her cause. And they say that ever after, while the Eagle's eggs lie in the nest in spring, the Beetle still sleeps in the ground.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral An old Lion, whose teeth and claws were so worn that it was not so easy for him to get food as in his younger days, pretended that he was sick. He took care to let all his neighbours know about it, and then lay down in his cave to wait for visitors.",
  "And when they came to offer him their sympathy, he ate them up one by one. The Fox came too, but he was very cautious about it. Standing at a safe distance from the cave, he inquired politely after the Lion's health. The Lion replied that he was very ill indeed, and asked the Fox to step in for a moment. But Master Fox very wisely stayed outside, thanking the Lion very kindly for the invitation.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 99. THE MAN AND THE LION A Lion and a Man chanced to travel in company through the forest. They soon began to quarrel, for each of them boasted that he and his kind were far superior to the other both in strength and mind.",

It was a representation of Heracles in the act of tearing the jaws of the Nemean Lion. \"See,\" said the man, \"that's how strong we are! The King of Beasts is like wax in our hands!\" \"Ho!\" laughed the Lion, \"a Man made that statue. It would have been quite a different scene had a Lion made it!\"",
  "Moral: It all depends on the point of view, and who tells the story. 100. THE ASS AND THE LAP DOG There was once an Ass whose Master also owned a Lap Dog. This Dog was a favourite and received many a pat and kind word from his Master, as well as choice bits from his plate.",
  "Every day the Dog would run to meet the Master, frisking playfully about and leaping up to lick his hands and face. All this the Ass saw with much discontent. Though he was well fed, he had much work to do; besides, the Master hardly ever took any notice of him.",
  "Now the jealous Ass got it into his silly head that all he had to do to win his Master's favour was to act like the Dog. So one day he left his stable and clattered eagerly into the house. Finding his Master seated at the dinner table, he kicked up his heels and, with a loud bray, pranced giddily around the table, upsetting it as he did so. Then he planted his forefeet on his Master's knees and rolled out his tongue to lick the Master's face, as he had seen the Dog do.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral The Master was much alarmed at the strange behaviour of the Ass, and calling for help, soon attracted the attention of the servants. When they saw the danger the Master was in from the clumsy beast, they set upon the Ass and drove him with kicks and blows back to the stable.",

  "The butter I make I will take to market, and with the money I get for it I will buy a lot of eggs for hatching.

  "Moral: Men often condemn others for what they see no wrong in doing themselves. 103. THE GOATHERD AND THE GOAT A Goat strayed away from the fock, tempted by a patch of clover.

  "I couldn't think of spending any of it.\" The stranger picked up a large stone and threw it into the hole. \"If that is the case,\" he said, \"cover up that stone. It is worth just as much to you as the treasure you lost!\" Moral: A possession is worth no more than the use we make of it.",
  "THE WOLF AND THE HOUSE DOG There was once a Wolf who got very little to eat because the Dogs of the village were so wide awake and watchful. He was really nothing but skin and bones, and it made him very downhearted to think of it. One night this Wolf happened to fall in with a fne fat House Dog who had wandered a little too far from home. The Wolf would gladly have eaten him then and there, but the House Dog looked strong enough to leave his marks should he try it. So the Wolf spoke very humbly to the Dog, complimenting him on his fne appearance.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral \"You can be as well-fed as I am if you want to,\" replied the Dog. \"Leave the woods; there you live miserably. Why, you have to fght hard for every bite you get. Follow my example and you will get along beautifully.\"",

But just then he noticed that the hair on the Dog's neck was worn and the skin was chafed.",
  "A chain!\" cried the Wolf. \"Don't you go wherever you please?\" \"Not always! But what's the difference?\" replied the Dog. \"All the difference in the world! I don't care a rap for your feasts and I wouldn't take all the tender young lambs in the world at that price.\" And away ran the Wolf to the woods.",
  "Moral: There is nothing worth so much as liberty. 106. THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG A Fox, swimming across a river, was barely able to reach the bank, where he lay bruised and exhausted from his struggle with the swift current.

Every Mouse I catch, I am going to eat!\" \"But I am not a Mouse!\" cried the Bat.",
  "Can Mice fy? Why, I am only a Bird! Please let me go!\" The Weasel had to admit that the Bat was not a Mouse, so he let him go.

THE FOX WITHOUT A TAIL A Fox that had been caught in a trap, succeeded at last, after much painful tugging, in getting away.",
  "But he had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him. For a long time he kept away from the other Foxes, for he knew well enough that they would all make fun of him and crack jokes and laugh behind his back. But it was hard for him to live alone, and at last he thought of a plan that would perhaps help him out of his trouble.",
  "He called a meeting of all the Foxes, saying that he had something of great importance to tell the tribe. When they were all gathered together, the Fox Without a Tail got up and made a long speech about those Foxes who had come to harm because of their tails. This one had been caught by hounds when his tail had become entangled in the hedge.",
  "That one had not been able to run fast enough because of the weight of his brush. Besides, it was well known, he said, that men hunt Foxes simply for their tails, which they cut off as prizes of the hunt. With such proof of the danger and uselessness of having a tail, said Master Fox, he would advise every Fox to cut it off, if he valued life and safety. When he had fnished talking, an old Fox arose, and said, smiling: \"Master Fox, kindly turn around for a moment, and you shall have your answer.\" When the poor Fox Without a Tail turned around, there arose such a storm of jeers and hooting, that he saw how useless it was to try any longer to persuade the Foxes to part with their tails.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 110. THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG There was once a Dog who was so ill- natured and mischievous that his Master had to fasten a heavy wooden clog about his neck to keep him from annoying visitors and neighbours. But the Dog seemed to be very proud of the clog and dragged it about noisily as if he wished to attract everybody's attention.",

Do you want everybody to know what a disgraceful and ill-natured Dog you are?\" Moral: Notoriety is not fame. 111. THE ROSE AND THE BUTTERFLY A Butterfy once fell in love with a beautiful Rose. The Rose was not indifferent, for the Butterfy's wings were powdered in a charming pattern of gold and silver.",

  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral away. I wish he had stung you!\" \"Constancy!\" laughed the Butterfy. \"I had no sooner left you than I saw Zephyr kissing you.

  "You can't expect any constancy from me!\" Moral: Do not expect constancy in others if you have none yourself. 112. THE CAT AND THE FOX Once a Cat and a Fox were traveling together. As they went along, picking up provisions on the way—a stray mouse here, a fat chicken there—they began an argument to while away the time between bites.",
  "And, as usually happens when comrades argue, the talk began to get personal. \"You think you are extremely clever, don't you?\" said the Fox. \"Do you pretend to know more than I? Why, I know a whole sackful of tricks!\" \"Well,\" retorted the Cat, \"I admit I know one trick only, but that one, let me tell you, is worth a thousand of yours!\"",
  "Just then, close by, they heard a hunter's horn and the yelping of a pack of hounds. In an instant the Cat was up a tree, hiding among the leaves. \"This is my trick,\" he called to the Fox. \"Now let me see what yours are worth.\" But the Fox had so many plans for escape he could not decide which one to try frst.",
  "He dodged here and there with the hounds at his heels. He doubled on his tracks, he ran at top speed, he entered a dozen burrows,—but all in vain. The hounds caught him, and soon put an end to the boaster and all his tricks. Moral: Common sense is always worth more than cunning.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 113. THE BOY AND THE NETTLE A Boy, stung by a Nettle, ran home crying, to get his mother to blow on the hurt and kiss it. \"Son,\" said the Boy's mother, when she had comforted him, \"the next time you come near a Nettle, grasp it frmly, and it will be as soft as silk.\"",
  "Moral: Whatever you do, do with all your might. 114. THE OLD LION A Lion had grown very old. His teeth were worn away. His limbs could no longer bear him, and the King of Beasts was very pitiful indeed as he lay gasping on the ground, about to die.",
  "Where now his strength and his former graceful beauty? Now a Boar spied him, and rushing at him, gored him with his yellow tusk. A Bull trampled him with his heavy hoofs. Even a contemptible Ass let fy his heels and brayed his insults in the face of the Lion.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral One moonlight evening as Master Fox was taking his usual stroll in the woods, he saw a number of Pheasants perched quite out of his reach on a limb of a tall old tree. The sly Fox soon found a bright patch of moonlight, where the Pheasants could see him clearly; there he raised himself up on his hind legs, and began a wild dance.",
  "First he whirled 'round and 'round like a top, then he hopped up and down, cutting all sorts of strange capers. The Pheasants stared giddily. They hardly dared blink for fear of losing him out of their sight a single instant. Now the Fox made as if to climb a tree, now he fell over and lay still, playing dead, and the next instant he was hopping on all fours, his back in the air, and his bushy tail shaking so that it seemed to throw out silver sparks in the moonlight.",
  "By this time the poor birds' heads were in a whirl. And when the Fox began his performance all over again, so dazed did they become, that they lost their hold on the limb, and fell down one by one to the Fox. Moral: Too much attention to danger may cause us to fall victims to it.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral 116. TWO TRAVELERS AND A BEAR Two Men were traveling in company through a forest, when, all at once, a huge Bear crashed out of the brush near them. One of the Men, thinking of his own safety, climbed a tree.",
  "The other, unable to fght the savage beast alone, threw himself on the ground and lay still, as if he were dead. He had heard that a Bear will not touch a dead body. It must have been true, for the Bear snuffed at the Man's head awhile, and then, seeming to be satisfed that he was dead, walked away.",
  "The Man in the tree climbed down. \"It looked just as if that Bear whispered in your ear,\" he said. \"What did he tell you?\" \"He said,\" answered the other, \"that it was not at all wise to keep company with a fellow who would desert his friend in a moment of danger.\"",
  "Moral: Misfortune is the test of true friendship. 117. THE PORCUPINE AND THE SNAKES A Porcupine was looking for a good home. At last he found a little sheltered cave, where lived a family of Snakes. He asked them to let him share the cave with them, and the Snakes kindly consented.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral The Snakes soon wished they had not given him permission to stay. His sharp quills pricked them at every turn, and at last they politely asked him to leave. \"I am very well satisfed, thank you,\" said the Porcupine.",

THE FOX AND THE MONKEY At a great meeting of the Animals, who had gathered to elect a new ruler, the Monkey was asked to dance.",
  "This he did so well, with a thousand funny capers and grimaces, that the Animals were carried entirely off their feet with enthusiasm, and then and there, elected him their king. The Fox did not vote for the Monkey and was much disgusted with the Animals for electing so unworthy a ruler.",
  "One day he found a trap with a bit of meat in it. Hurrying to King Monkey, he told him he had found a rich treasure, which he had not touched because it belonged by right to his majesty the Monkey. The greedy Monkey followed the Fox to the trap.",
  "As soon as he saw the meat he grasped eagerly for it, only to fnd himself held fast in the trap. The Fox stood off and laughed. \"You pretend to be our king,\" he said, \"and cannot even take care of yourself!\" Shortly after that, another election among the Animals was held.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral Early one morning a hungry Wolf was prowling around a cottage at the edge of a village, when he heard a child crying in the house. Then he heard the Mother's voice say: \"Hush, child, hush! Stop your crying, or I will give you to the Wolf!\"",
  "Surprised but delighted at the prospect of so delicious a meal, the Wolf settled down under an open window, expecting every moment to have the child handed out to him. But though the little one continued to fret, the Wolf waited all day in vain. Then, toward nightfall, he heard the Mother's voice again as she sat down near the window to sing and rock her baby to sleep.",
  "The Wolf shall not get you. No, no! Daddy is watching and Daddy will kill him if he should come near!\" Just then the Father came within sight of the home, and the Wolf was barely able to save himself from the Dogs by a clever bit of running. Moral: Do not believe everything you hear.",

  "No, indeed; they settled right down, feet and all, to gorge themselves. The Flies were quickly smeared from head to foot with honey. Their wings stuck together. They could not pull their feet out of the sticky mass. And so they died, giving their lives for the sake of a taste of sweetness.",

  "Many died, and those who lived were so ill, that they cared for neither food nor drink, and dragged themselves about listlessly. No longer could a fat young hen tempt Master Fox to dinner, nor a tender lamb rouse greedy Sir Wolf's appetite. At last the Lion decided to call a council.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral us must be offered in sacrifce. Perhaps we may thus obtain forgiveness and cure for all. \"I will confess all my sins frst. I admit that I have been very greedy and have devoured many sheep. They had done me no harm.",
  "I have eaten goats and bulls and stags. To tell the truth, I even ate up a shepherd now and then. \"Now, if I am the most guilty, I am ready to be sacrifced. But I think it best that each one confess his sins as I have done. Then we can decide in all justice who is the most guilty.\"",
  "Can it be a crime to eat sheep, such stupid mutton heads? No, no, your majesty. You have done them great honor by eating them up. \"And so far as shepherds are concerned, we all know they belong to that puny race that pretends to be our masters.\" All the animals applauded the Fox loudly.",
  "Then, though the Tiger, the Bear, the Wolf, and all the savage beasts recited the most wicked deeds, all were excused and made to appear very saint-like and innocent. It was now the Ass's turn to confess. \"I remember,\" he said guiltily, \"that one day as I was passing a feld belonging to some priests, I was so tempted by the tender grass and my hunger, that I could not resist nibbling a bit of it.",
  "I had no right to do it, I admit—\" A great uproar among the beasts interrupted him. Here was the culprit who had brought misfortune on all of them! What a horrible crime it was to eat grass that belonged to someone else! It was enough to hang anyone for, much more an Ass.",
  "Immediately they all fell upon him, the Wolf in the lead, and soon had made an end to him, sacrifcing him to the gods then and there, and without the formality of an altar.

  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral Much irritated, he very loudly and boastfully declared that he would catch the thief and punish him as he deserved. The Shepherd suspected a Wolf of the deed and so set out toward a rocky region among the hills, where there were caves infested by Wolves.",
  "But before starting out he made a vow to Jupiter that if he would help him fnd the thief he would offer a fat Calf as a sacrifce. The Shepherd searched a long time without fnding any Wolves, but just as he was passing near a large cave on the mountain side, a huge Lion stalked out, carrying a Sheep.",
  "In great terror the Shepherd fell on his knees. \"Alas, O Jupiter, man does not know what he asks! To fnd the thief I offered to sacrifce a fat Calf. Now I promise you a full-grown Bull, if you but make the thief go away!\" Moral: We are often not so eager for what we seek, after we have found it.",
  "Do not foolishly ask for things that would bring ruin if they were granted. 125. THE DOG AND HIS REFLECTION A Dog, to whom the butcher had thrown a bone, was hurrying home with his prize as fast as he could go. As he crossed a narrow footbridge, he happened to look down and saw himself refected in the quiet water as if in a mirror.",
  "But the greedy Dog thought he saw a real Dog carrying a bone much bigger than his own. If he had stopped to think he would have known better. But instead of thinking, he dropped his bone and sprang at the Dog in the river, only to fnd himself swimming for dear life to reach the shore. At last he managed to scramble out, and as he stood sadly thinking about the good bone he had lost, he realized what a stupid Dog he had been.",

THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow. \"Do you ever get anywhere?\" he asked with a mocking laugh. \"Yes,\" replied the Tortoise, \"and I get there sooner than you think.",
  "I'll run you a race and prove it.\" The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.",
  "The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up. The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.",
  "Moral: The race is not always to the swift (Slow and steady wins the race). 127. THE BEES AND WASPS, AND THE HORNET A store of honey had been found in a hollow tree, and the Wasps declared positively that it belonged to them. The Bees were just as sure that the treasure was theirs.",
  "The argument grew very pointed, and it looked as if the affair could not be settled without a battle, when at last, with much good sense, they agreed to let a judge decide the matter. So they brought the case before the Hornet, justice of the peace in that part of the woods.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral When the Judge called the case, witnesses declared that they had seen certain winged creatures in the neighbourhood of the hollow tree, who hummed loudly, and whose bodies were striped, yellow and black, like Bees. Counsel for the Wasps immediately insisted that this description ftted his clients exactly.",
  "Such evidence did not help Judge Hornet to any decision, so he adjourned court for six weeks to give him time to think it over. When the case came up again, both sides had a large number of witnesses. An Ant was frst to take the stand, and was about to be cross-examined, when a wise old Bee addressed the Court.",
  "If it is not decided soon, the honey will not be ft for anything. I move that the Bees and the Wasps be both instructed to build a honey comb. Then we shall soon see to whom the honey really belongs.\" The Wasps protested loudly. Wise Judge Hornet quickly understood why they did so: They knew they could not build a honey comb and fll it with honey. \"It is clear,\" said the Judge, \"who made the comb and who could not have made it.",
  "The honey belongs to the Bees.\" Moral: Ability proves itself by deeds. 128. THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES A Lark made her nest in a feld of young wheat. As the days passed, the wheat stalks grew tall and the young birds, too, grew in strength. Then one day, when the ripe golden grain waved in the breeze, the Farmer and his son came into the feld.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral \"This wheat is now ready for reaping,\" said the Farmer. \"We must call in our neighbors and friends to help us harvest it.\" The young Larks in their nest close by were much frightened, for they knew they would be in great danger if they did not leave the nest before the reapers came. When the Mother Lark returned with food for them, they told her what they had heard. \"Do not be frightened, children,\" said the Mother Lark.",
  "A few days later, the wheat was so ripe, that when the wind shook the stalks, a hail of wheat grains came rustling down on the young Larks' heads. \"If this wheat is not harvested at once,\" said the Farmer, \"we shall lose half the crop. We cannot wait any longer for help from our friends.",
  "Tomorrow we must set to work, ourselves.\" When the young Larks told their mother what they had heard that day, she said: \"Then we must be off at once. When a man decides to do his own work and not depend on any one else, then you may be sure there will be no more delay.\"",
  "There was much futtering and trying out of wings that afternoon, and at sunrise next day, when the Farmer and his son cut down the grain, they found an empty nest.

Very timidly at frst they stuck out their heads and sniffed about carefully.",
  "But as nothing stirred, all trooped joyfully out to celebrate the death of the Cat. Just then the Cat let go his hold, and before the Mice recovered from their surprise, he had made an end of three or four. Now the Mice kept more strictly at home than ever. But the Cat, who was still hungry for Mice, knew more tricks than one.",
  "Rolling himself in four until he was covered completely, he lay down in the four bin, with one eye open for the Mice. Sure enough, the Mice soon began to come out. To the Cat it was almost as if he already had a plump young Mouse under his claws, when an old Rat, who had had much experience with Cats and traps, and had even lost a part of his tail to pay for it, sat up at a safe distance from a hole in the wall where he lived.",
  "Whatever it is, it is wisest to keep at a safe distance.\" Moral: The wise do not let themselves be tricked a second time. 130. THE FOX AND THE CROW One bright morning as the Fox was following his sharp nose through the wood in search of a bite to eat, he saw a Crow on the limb of a tree overhead. This was by no means the frst Crow the Fox had ever seen.",
  "What caught his attention this time and made him stop for a second look, was that the lucky Crow held a bit of cheese in her beak. \"No need to search any farther,\" thought sly Master Fox. \"Here is a dainty bite for my breakfast.\" Up he trotted to the foot of the tree in which the Crow was sitting, and looking up admiringly, he cried, \"Good-morning, beautiful creature!\"",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral The Crow, her head cocked on one side, watched the Fox suspiciously. But she kept her beak tightly closed on the cheese and did not return his greeting. \"What a charming creature she is!\" said the Fox. \"How her feathers shine!",
  "What a beautiful form and what splendid wings! Such a wonderful Bird should have a very lovely voice, since everything else about her is so perfect. Could she sing just one song, I know I should hail her Queen of Birds.\" Listening to these fattering words, the Crow forgot all her suspicion, and also her breakfast.",
  "She wanted very much to be called Queen of Birds. So she opened her beak wide to utter her loudest caw, and down fell the cheese straight into the Fox's open mouth. \"Thank you,\" said Master Fox sweetly, as he walked off. \"Though it is cracked, you have a voice sure enough.",
  "But where are your wits?\" Moral: The fatterer lives at the expense of those who will listen to him. 131. THE ASS AND ITS SHADOW A Traveller had hired an Ass to carry him to a distant part of the country. The owner of the Ass went with the Traveler, walking beside him to drive the Ass and point out the way.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral found, the Traveler sat down in the shadow of the Ass. Now the heat had affected the Driver as much as it had the Traveller, and even more, for he had been walking. Wishing also to rest in the shade cast by the Ass, he began to quarrel with the Traveller, saying he had hired the Ass and not the shadow it cast.",
  "The two soon came to blows, and while they were fghting, the Ass took to its heels. Moral: In quarrelling about the shadow we often lose the substance. 132. THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THE ASS One day, a long time ago, an old Miller and his Son were on their way to market with an Ass which they hoped to sell.",
  "They drove him very slowly, for they thought they would have a better chance to sell him if they kept him in good condition. As they walked along the highway some travelers laughed loudly at them. \"What foolishness,\" cried one, \"to walk when they might as well ride. The most stupid of the three is not the one you would expect it to be.\"",
  "The Miller did not like to be laughed at, so he told his son to climb up and ride. They had gone a little farther along the road, when three merchants passed by. \"Oho, what have we here?\" they cried. \"Respect old age, young man! Get down, and let the old man ride.\"",
  "Though the Miller was not tired, he made the boy get down and climbed up himself to ride, just to please the Merchants. At the next turnstile they overtook some women carrying market baskets loaded with vegetables and other things to sell. \"Look at the old fool,\" exclaimed one of them.",
  "The Miller felt a bit vexed, but to be agreeable he told the Boy to climb up behind him. They had no sooner started out again than a loud shout went up from another company of people on the road. \"What a crime,\" cried one, \"to load up a Free eBook from https://www.freekidsbooks.org Page 117",

They look more able to carry the poor creature, than he to carry them.\" \"They must be on their way to sell the poor thing's hide,\" said another. The Miller and his Son quickly scrambled down, and a short time later, the market place was thrown into an uproar as the two came along carrying the Donkey slung from a pole.",
  "A great crowd of people ran out to get a closer look at the strange sight. The Ass did not dislike being carried, but so many people came up to point at him and laugh and shout, that he began to kick and bray, and then, just as they were crossing a bridge, the ropes that held him gave way, and down he tumbled into the river.",
  "The poor Miller now set out sadly for home. By trying to please everybody, he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass besides. Moral: If you try to please all, you please none. 133. THE ANT AND THE DOVE A Dove saw an Ant fall into a brook. The Ant struggled in vain to reach the bank, and in pity, the Dove dropped a blade of straw close beside it. Clinging to the straw like a shipwrecked sailor to a broken spar, the Ant foated safely to shore.",
  "Soon after, the Ant saw a man getting ready to kill the Dove with a stone. But just as he cast the stone, the Ant stung him in the heel, so that the pain made him miss his aim, and the startled Dove few to safety in a distant wood.",

  "But one cold winter evening, as they were walking homeward, the Satyr saw the Man blow on his fngers. \"Why do you do that?\" asked the Satyr. \"To warm my hands,\" the Man replied. When they reached home the Man prepared two bowls of porridge. These he placed steaming hot on the table, and the comrades sat down very cheerfully to enjoy the meal.",
  "But much to the Satyr's surprise, the Man began to blow into his bowl of porridge. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. \"To cool my porridge,\" replied the Man. The Satyr sprang hurriedly to his feet and made for the door. \"Goodby,\" he said, \"I've seen enough. A fellow that blows hot and cold in the same breath cannot be friends with me!\"",
  "Moral: The man who talks for both sides is not to be trusted by either. 135.

  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral Strangely enough, a Wolf was lurking near and heard what the Goat had said. So, as soon as Mother Goat was out of sight, up he trotted to the door and knocked. \"Down with the Wolf and all his race,\" said the Wolf softly.",
  "It was the right password, but when the Kid peeped through a crack in the door and saw the shadowy fgure outside, he did not feel at all easy. \"Show me a white paw,\" he said, \"or I won't let you in.\" A white paw, of course, is a feature few Wolves can show, and so Master Wolf had to go away as hungry as he had come.",
  "Moral: Two sureties are better than one. 136. THE SWALLOW AND THE CROW The Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage. Said the Swallow: \"Just look at my bright and downy feathers. Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why don't you dress better?",
  "Show a little pride!\" \"Your feathers may do very well in spring,\" replied the Crow, \"but—I don't remember ever having seen you around in winter, and that's when I enjoy myself most.\" Moral: Friends in fne weather only (fair weather friends) , are not worth much. 137.

As you can imagine, there was quite a laugh when the Animals saw the ugly fat-nosed, hairless, pop-eyed little creature. \"Laugh if you will,\" said the Mother Monkey. \"Though Jupiter may not give him the prize, I know that he is the prettiest, the sweetest, the dearest darling in the world.\"",
  "Moral: Mother love is blind. 138. THE LION, THE ASS, AND THE FOX A Lion, an Ass, and a Fox were hunting in company, and caught a large quantity of game. The Ass was asked to divide the spoil. This he did very fairly, giving each an equal share. The Fox was well satisfed, but the Lion few into a great rage over it, and with one stroke of his huge paw, he added the Ass to the pile of slain. Then he turned to the Fox.",
  "The Fox wasted no time in talking. He quickly piled all the game into one great heap. From this he took a very small portion for himself, such undesirable bits as the horns and hoofs of a mountain goat, and the end of an ox tail. The Lion now recovered his good humour entirely.",
  "Aesop's Fables for Children – Illustrated short stories with a moral One day the Wolf ran down a Stag and immediately called his comrades to divide the spoil. Without being asked, the Lion placed himself at the head of the feast to do the carving, and, with a great show of fairness, began to count the guests.",
  "Two, that's the Wolf, three, is the Jackal, and the Fox makes four.\" He then very carefully divided the Stag into four equal parts. \"I am King Lion,\" he said, when he had fnished, \"so of course I get the frst part. This next part falls to me because I am the strongest; and this is mine because I am the bravest.\"",
  "He now began to glare at the others very savagely. \"If any of you have any claim to the part that is left,\" he growled, stretching his claws meaningly, \"now is the time to speak up.\" Moral: Might makes right. 140. THE MOLE AND HIS MOTHER A little Mole once said to his Mother: \"Why, Mother, you said I was blind!",
  "But I am sure I can see!\" Mother Mole saw she would have to get such conceit out of his head. So she put a bit of frankincense before him and asked him to tell what it was.

  "With the frst gust of wind the ends of the cloak whipped about the Traveler's body. But he immediately wrapped it closely around him, and the harder the Wind blew, the tighter he held it to him. The North Wind tore angrily at the cloak, but all his efforts were in vain.",
  "Then the Sun began to shine. At frst his beams were gentle, and in the pleasant warmth after the bitter cold of the North Wind, the Traveler unfastened his cloak and let it hang loosely from his shoulders. The Sun's rays grew warmer and warmer. The man took off his cap and mopped his brow.",

He was very angry to think that any animal that he chose for a meal, should be so brazen as to wear such dangerous things as horns to scratch him while he ate. So he commanded that all animals with horns should leave his domains within twenty-four hours.",
  "The command struck terror among the beasts. All those who were so unfortunate as to have horns, began to pack up and move out. Even the Hare, who, as you know, has no horns and so had nothing to fear, passed a very restless night, dreaming awful dreams about the fearful Lion.",
  "And when he came out of the warren in the early morning sunshine, and there saw the shadow cast by his long and pointed ears, a terrible fright seized him. \"Goodby, neighbour Cricket,\" he called. \"I'm off. He will certainly make out that my ears are horns, no matter what I say.\"",

  "A Cock, rising early, discovered what had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so he went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy. The Fox saw a slender chance of escape. \"Dear friend,\" he said, \"I was just on my way to visit a sick relative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangled up.",
  "But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causing sorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string to pieces.\" But the Cock was not to be so easily fooled. He soon roused the whole hen yard, and when the Farmer came running out, that was the end of Mr. Fox.",
  "Moral: The wicked deserve no aid. 145. THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN An Ass found a Lion's skin left in the forest by a hunter. He dressed himself in it, and amused himself by hiding in a thicket and rushing out suddenly at the animals who passed that way.",
  "All took to their heels the moment they saw him. The Ass was so pleased to see the animals running away from him, just as if he were King Lion himself, that he could not keep from expressing his delight by a loud, harsh bray.

  "I am so small it is not worth while to carry me home. When I am bigger, I shall make you a much better meal.\" But the Fisherman quickly put the fsh into his basket. \"How foolish I should be,\" he said, \"to throw you back. However small you may be, you are better than nothing at all.\"",

Around Ozma's throne, on such occasions, are grouped all the important personages of Oz, such as the Scarecrow, Jack Pumpkinhead, Tiktok the Clockwork Man, the Tin Woodman, the Wizard of Oz, the Shaggy Man and other famous fairy people.",
  "These two beasts are Ozma's chief guardians, but as everyone loves the beautiful girl Princess there has never been any disturbance in the great Throne Room, or anything for the guardians to do but look fierce and solemn and keep quiet until the Royal Audience is over and the people go away to their homes.",
  "Of course no one would dare be naughty while the huge Lion and Tiger crouched beside the throne; but the fact is, the people of Oz are very seldom naughty. So Ozma's big guards are more ornamental than useful, and no one realizes that better than the beasts themselves. One day, after everybody had left the Throne Room except the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, the Lion yawned and said to his friend: \"I'm getting tired of this job.",
  "And I'm dreadfully hungry all the time.\" \"You have enough to eat, I'm sure,\" said the Lion, swaying his tail slowly back and forth. \"Enough, perhaps; but not the kind of food I long for,\" answered the Tiger. \"What I'm hungry for is fat babies. I have a great desire to eat a few fat babies.",
  "Then, perhaps, the people of Oz would fear me and I'd become more important.\" \"True,\" agreed the Lion. \"It would stir up quite a rumpus if you ate but one fat baby. As for myself; my claws are sharp as needles and strong as crowbars, while my teeth are powerful enough to tear a person to pieces in a few seconds.",
  "Emerald City and the people would fall upon their knees and beg me for mercy. That, in my opinion, would render me of considerable importance.\" \"After you had torn the person to pieces, what would you do next?\" asked the Tiger sleepily. \"Then I would roar so loudly it would shake the earth and stalk away to the jungle to hide myself, before anyone could attack me or kill me for what I had done.\"",
  "That is why I am named the Cowardly Lion. That is why I have always been so tame and peaceable. But I'm awfully tired of being tame,\" added the Lion, with a sigh, \"and it would be fun to raise a row and show people what a terrible beast I really am.\"",
  "The Tiger remained silent for several minutes, thinking deeply as he slowly washed his face with his left paw. Then he said: \"I'm getting old, and it would please me to eat at least one fat baby before I die. Suppose we surprise these people of Oz and prove our power.",
  "What do you say? We will walk out of here just as usual and the first baby we meet I'll eat in a jiffy, and the first man or woman you meet you will tear to pieces. Then we will both run out of the city gates and gallop across the country and hide in the jungle before anyone can stop us.\"",
  "The Tiger got up and stretched his great, sleek body. \"Come on,\" he said. The Lion stood up and proved he was the larger of the two, for he was almost as big as a small horse. Out of the palace they walked, and met no one. They passed through the beautiful grounds, past fountains and beds of lovely flowers, and met no one. Then they unlatched a gate and entered a street of the city, and met no one.",
  "He rushed around a corner, the Lion following, and came upon a nice fat baby sitting in the middle of the street and crying as if in great distress. \"What's the matter?\" asked the Tiger, crouching before the baby. \"I—I—I-lost my m-m-mamma!\" wailed the baby. \"Why, you poor little thing,\" said the great beast, softly stroking the child's head with its paw.",
  "The Lion growled low in his throat and seemed very much disappointed; but at that moment a scream reached their ears and a woman came bounding out of a house and into the street. Seeing her baby in the embrace of the monster Tiger the woman screamed again and rushed forward to rescue it, but in her haste she caught her foot in her skirt and tumbled head over heels and heels over head, stopping with such a bump that she saw many stars in the heavens, although it was broad daylight.",
  "Are you hurt?\" he gently asked. Gasping for breath the woman struggled to free herself and tried to walk, but she limped badly and tumbled down again. \"My baby!\" she said pleadingly. \"The baby is all right; don't worry,\" replied the Lion; and then he added: \"Keep quiet, now, and I'll carry you back to your house, and the Hungry Tiger will carry your baby.\" The Tiger, who had approached the place with the child in its arms, asked in astonishment: \"Aren't you going to tear her into sixty pieces?\"",
  "If you are so ferocious and cruel and bloodthirsty, you may leave me and go away, for I do not care to associate with you.\" \"That's all right,\" answered the Tiger. \"I'm not cruel—not in the least—I'm only hungry. But I thought you were cruel.\" \"Thank heaven I'm respectable,\" said the Lion, with dignity.",
  "He then raised the woman and with much gentleness carried her into her house, where he laid her upon a sofa. The Tiger followed with the baby, which he safely deposited beside its mother. The little one liked the Hungry Tiger and grasping the enormous beast by both ears the baby kissed the beast's nose to show he was grateful and happy.",
  "I do not think either of you have ever had an evil thought.\" The Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion hung their heads and did not look into each other's eyes, for both were shamed and humbled. They crept away and stalked back through the streets until they again entered the palace grounds, where they retreated to the pretty, comfortable rooms they occupied at the back of the palace.",
  "There they silently crouched in their usual corners to think over their adventure. After a while the Tiger said sleepily: \"I don't believe fat babies taste like gumdrops. I'm quite sure they have the flavor of raspberry tarts. My, how hungry I am for fat babies!\" The Lion grunted disdainfully.",
  "The Lion impatiently thumped the floor with his tail. \"To tear anyone into pieces would soil my claws and blunt my teeth,\" he said. \"I'm glad I didn't muss myself up this afternoon by hurting that poor mother.\" The Tiger looked at him steadily and then yawned a wide, wide yawn.",
  "For, had I eaten that fat baby I would not now be the Hungry Tiger. It's better to go hungry, seems to me, than to be cruel to a little child.\" And then they dropped their heads on their paws and went to sleep. LITTLE DOROTHY AND TOTO OROTHY was a little Kansas girl who once accidentally found the beautiful Land of Oz and was invited to live there always. Toto was Dorothy's small black dog, with fuzzy, curly hair and bright black eyes.",
  "Together, when they tired of the grandeur of the Emerald City of Oz, they would wander out into the country and all through the land, peering into queer nooks and corners and having a good time in their own simple way. There was a little Wizard living in Oz who was a faithful friend of Dorothy and did not approve of her traveling alone in this way, but the girl always laughed at the little man's fears for her and said she was not afraid of anything that might happen.",
  "One day while on such a journey, Dorothy and Toto found themselves among the wild wooded hills at the southeast of Oz—a place usually avoided by travelers because so many magical things abounded there. And, as they entered a forest path, the little girl noticed a sign tacked to a tree, which said: \"Look out for Crinklink.\"",
  "Toto could not talk, as many of the animals of Oz can, for he was just a common Kansas dog; but he looked at the sign so seriously that Dorothy almost believed he could read it, and she knew quite well that Toto understood every word she said to him.",
  "The path was narrow and wound here and there between the trees, but they could not lose their way, because thick vines and creepers shut them in on both sides. They had walked a long time when, suddenly turning a curve of the pathway, they came upon a lake of black water, so big and so deep that they were forced to stop.",
  "Dorothy couldn't help feeling surprised, for she could have picked the little man up with one hand, and the lake was big and broad. Looking at the ferryman more closely she saw that he had small eyes, a big nose, and a sharp chin. His hair was blue and his clothes scarlet, and Dorothy noticed that every button on his jacket was the head of some animal.",
  "The top button was a bear's head and the next button a wolf's head; the next was a cat's head and the next a weasel's head, while the last button of all was the head of a field-mouse. When Dorothy looked into the eyes of these animals' heads, they all nodded and said in a chorus: \"Don't believe all you hear, little girl!\"",
  "Dorothy wanted to get across, in order that she might continue her journey. \"All right,\" she said, closing her eyes; \"I'm ready.\" Instantly she was seized in a pair of strong arms—arms so big and powerful that she was startled and cried out in fear. \"Silence!\" roared a great voice, and the girl opened her eyes to find that the tiny man had suddenly grown to a giant and was holding both her and Toto in a tight embrace while in one step he spanned the lake and reached the other shore.",
  "Dorothy became frightened, then, especially as the giant did not stop but continued tramping in great steps over the wooded hills, crushing bushes and trees beneath his broad feet. She struggled in vain to free herself, while Toto whined and trembled beside her, for the little dog was frightened, too.",
  "But the giant paid no attention. \"Who are you, and where are you taking me?\" she continued; but the giant said not a word. Close to Dorothy's ear, however, a voice answered her, saying: \"This is the terrible Crinklink, and he has you in his power.\" Dorothy managed to twist her head around and found it was the second button on the jacket—the wolf's head—which had spoken to her.",
  "You must wait and see,\" replied the wolf. \"Some of his captives he whips,\" squeaked the weasel's head. \"Some he transforms into bugs and other things,\" growled the bear's head. \"Some he enchants, so that they become doorknobs,\" sighed the cat's head. \"Some he makes his slaves—even as we are—and that is the most dreadful fate of all,\" added the field-mouse. \"As long as Crinklink exists we shall remain buttons, but as there are no more buttonholes on his jacket he will probably make you a slave.\"",
  "Dorothy began to wish she had not met Crinklink. Meantime, the giant took such big steps that he soon reached the heart of the hills, where, perched upon the highest peak, stood a log castle. Before this castle he paused to set down Dorothy and Toto, for Crinklink was at present far too large to enter his own doorway.",
  "So he made himself grow smaller, until he was about the size of an ordinary man. Then he said to Dorothy, in stern, commanding tones: \"Enter, girl!\" Dorothy obeyed and entered the castle, with Toto at her heels. She found the place to be merely one big room. There was a table and chair of ordinary size near the center, and at one side a wee bed that seemed scarcely big enough for a doll.",
  "Dorothy's captor sat down in the chair and frowned at her. \"You are young and strong, and will make a good dishwasher,\" said he. \"Do you mean me to wash all those dishes?\" she asked, feeling both indignant and fearful, for such a task would take weeks to accomplish. \"That's just what I mean,\" he retorted.",
  "So get to work and be careful not to break anything. If you smash a dish, the penalty is one lash from my dreadful cat-o'- nine-tails for every piece the dish breaks into,\" and here Crinklink displayed a terrible whip that made the little girl shudder. Dorothy knew how to wash dishes, but she remembered that often she carelessly broke one.",
  "In this case, however, a good deal depended on being careful, so she handled the dishes very cautiously. While she worked, Toto sat by the hearth and growled low at Crinklink, and Crinklink sat in his chair and growled at Dorothy because she moved so slowly. He expected her to break a dish any minute, but as the hours passed away and this did not happen Crinklink began to grow sleepy.",
  "But the buttons on my jacket will be wide awake and whenever you break a dish the crash will waken me. As I'm rather sleepy I hope you won't interrupt my nap by breaking anything for a long time.\" Then Crinklink made himself grow smaller and smaller until he was three inches high and of a size to fit the tiny bed.",
  "At once he lay down and fell fast asleep. Dorothy came close to the buttons and whispered: \"Would you really warn Crinklink if I tried to escape?\" \"You can't escape,\" growled the bear. \"Crinklink would become a giant, and soon overtake you.\" \"But you might kill him while he sleeps,\" suggested the cat, in a soft voice.",
  "But Toto had heard this conversation and was not so particular about killing monsters. Also the little dog knew he must try to save his mistress. In an instant he sprang upon the wee bed and was about to seize the sleeping Crinklink in his jaws when Dorothy heard a loud crash and a heap of dishes fell from the table to the floor.",
  "Then the girl saw Toto and the little man rolling on the floor together, like a fuzzy ball, and when the ball stopped rolling, behold! there was Toto wagging his tail joyfully and there sat the little Wizard of Oz, laughing merrily at the expression of surprise on Dorothy's face.",
  "I wanted to prove to you that it is really dangerous for a little girl to wander alone in a fairy country; so I took the form of Crinklink to teach you a lesson. There isn't any Crinklink, to be sure; but if there had been you'd be severely whipped for breaking all those dishes.\"",
  "The Wizard now rose, took off the coat with the button heads, and spread it on the floor, wrong side up. At once there crept from beneath it a bear, a wolf, a cat, a weasel, and a field-mouse, who all rushed from the room and escaped into the mountains.",
  "TIKT OK AND THE NOME KING HE Nome King was unpleasantly angry. He had carelessly bitten his tongue at breakfast and it still hurt; so he roared and raved and stamped around in his underground palace in a way that rendered him very disagreeable. It so happened that on this unfortunate day Tiktok, the Clockwork Man, visited the Nome King to ask a favor.",
  "Although so cleverly constructed, the Clockwork Man was far from perfect. Three separate keys wound up his motion machinery, his speech works, and his thoughts. One or more of these contrivances was likely to run down at a critical moment, leaving poor Tiktok helpless. Also some of his parts were wearing out, through much use, and just now his thought machinery needed repair.",
  "The skillful little Wizard of Oz had tinkered with Tiktok's thoughts without being able to get them properly regulated, so he had advised the Clockwork Man to go to the Nome King and secure a new set of springs, which would render his thoughts more elastic and responsive. \"Be careful what you say to the Nome King,\" warned the Wizard.",
  "He ran down just as he reached the entrance to the underground palace, and there Kaliko, the Nome King's Chief Steward, found him and wound him up again. \"I want to see the King,\" said Tiktok, in his jerky voice. \"Well,\" remarked Kaliko, \"it may be safe for a cast-iron person like you to face his Majesty this morning; but you must announce yourself, for should I show my face inside the jewel-studded cavern where the King is now raving, I'd soon look like a dish of mashed potatoes, and be of no further use to anyone.\"",
  "Tiktok promptly walked in and faced the astonished Nome King, to whom he said: \"Good morn-ing. I want two new steel springs for my thought-works and a new cog- wheel for my speech-pro-du-cer. How a-bout it, your Maj-es-ty?\" The Nome King growled a menacing growl and his eyes were red with rage.",
  "This was true, yet an unwise speech. Had Tiktok's thoughts been in good working order he would have said something else. The angry Nome King quickly caught up his heavy mace and hurled it straight at Tiktok. When it struck the metal man's breast, the force of the blow burst the bolts which held the plates of his body together and they clattered to the floor in a score of pieces.",
  "Where Tiktok had stood was now only a scrap-heap and the Nome King was so amazed by the terrible effect of his blow that he stared in wonder. His Majesty's anger quickly cooled. He remembered that the Clockwork Man was a favorite subject of the powerful Princess, Ozma of Oz, who would be sure to resent Tiktok's ruin.",
  "I didn't know he'd break.\" \"You'd better be,\" remarked Kaliko, who now ventured to enter the room. \"You'll have a war on your hands when Ozma hears of this, and the chances are you will lose your throne and your kingdom.\" The Nome King turned pale, for he loved to rule the Nomes and did not know of any other way to earn a living in case Ozma fought and conquered him.",
  "You've made scrap-iron of her favorite.\" The King groaned. \"Sweep him up and throw the rubbish into the black pit,\" he commanded; and then he shut himself up in his private den and for days would see no one, because he was so ashamed of his unreasoning anger and so feared the results of his rash act.",
  "Kaliko swept up the pieces, but he did not throw them into the black pit. Being a clever and skillful mechanic he determined to fit the pieces together again. No man ever faced a greater puzzle; but it was interesting work and Kaliko succeeded. When he found a spring or wheel worn or imperfect, he made a new one.",
  "Within two weeks, by working steadily night and day, the Chief Steward completed his task and put the three sets of clockworks and the last rivet into Tiktok's body. He then wound up the motion machinery, and the Clockwork Man walked up and down the room as naturally as ever.",
  "Then Kaliko wound up the thought works and the speech regulator and said to Tiktok: \"How do you feel now?\" \"Fine,\" said the Clockwork Man. \"You have done a ve-ry good job, Kal-i-ko, and saved me from de-struc-tion. Much o-bliged.\" \"Don't mention it,\" replied the Chief Steward. \"I quite enjoyed the work.\"",
  "Of course Ozma will have revenge, and send an army to fight us, but we must take our medicine. One thing comforts me: Tiktok wasn't really a live person; he was only a machine man, and so it wasn't very wicked to stop his clockworks. I couldn't sleep nights, at first, for worry; but there's no more harm in smashing a machine man than in breaking a wax doll.",
  "Don't you think so?\" \"I am too humble to think in the presence of your Majesty,\" said Kaliko. \"Then get me something to eat,\" commanded the King, \"for I'm nearly starved. Two roasted goats, a barrel of cakes and nine mince pies will do me until dinnertime.\" Kaliko bowed and hurried away to the royal kitchen, forgetting Tiktok, who was wandering around in the outer cavern.",
  "Suddenly the Nome King looked up and saw the Clockwork Man standing before him, and at the sight the monarch's eyes grew big and round and he fell a-trembling in every limb. \"Away, grim Shadow!\" he cried. \"You're not here, you know; you're only a hash of cogwheels and springs, lying at the bottom of the black pit.",
  "But the sound of a voice coming from what he thought a mere vision was too much for the Nome King's shaken nerves. He gave a yell of fear and rushed from the room. Tiktok followed, so the King bolted through the corridors on a swift run and bumped against Kaliko, who was returning with a tray of things to eat.",
  "Here comes a phantom clockwork man!\" screamed the terrified monarch, and every Nome dropped his tools and made a rush from the cavern, knocking over their King in their mad flight and recklessly trampling upon his prostrate fat body. So, when Tiktok came into the cavern, there was only the Nome King left, and he was rolling upon the rocky floor and howling for mercy, with his eyes fast shut so that he could not see what he was sure was a dreadful phantom that was coming straight toward him.",
  "A phan-tom is unreal, while I am the real thing.\" The King rolled over, sat up and opened his eyes. \"Didn't I smash you to pieces?\" he asked in trembling tones. \"Yes,\" said Tiktok. \"Then you are nothing but a junk-heap, and this form in which you now appear cannot be real.\"",
  "I'm as good as new, and perhaps bet-ter.\" \"That is true, your Majesty,\" added Kaliko, who now made his appearance, \"and I hope you will forgive me for mending Tiktok. He was quite broken up, after you smashed him, and I found it almost as hard a job to match his pieces as to pick turnips from gooseberry bushes.",
  "OZMA AND THE LITTLE WIZARD NCE upon a time there lived in the beautiful Emerald City, which lies in the center of the fairy Land of Oz, a lovely girl called Princess Ozma, who was ruler of all that country. And among those who served this girlish Ruler and lived in a cozy suite of rooms in her splendid palace, was a little, withered old man known as the Wizard of Oz.",
  "This little Wizard could do a good many queer things in magic; but he was a kind man, with merry, twinkling eyes and a sweet smile; so, instead of fearing him because of his magic, everybody loved him. Now, Ozma was very anxious that all her people who inhabited the pleasant Land of Oz should be happy and contented, and therefore she decided one morning to make a journey to all parts of the country, that she might discover if anything was amiss, or anyone discontented, or if there was any wrong that ought to be righted.",
  "She asked the little Wizard to accompany her and he was glad to go. \"Shall I take my bag of magic tools with me?\" he asked. \"Of course,\" said Ozma. \"We may need a lot of magic before we return, for we are going into strange corners of the land, where we may meet with unknown creatures and dangerous adventures.\"",
  "So the Wizard took his bag of magic tools and the two left the Emerald City and wandered over the country for many days, at last reaching a place far up in the mountains which neither of them had ever visited before. Stopping one morning at a cottage, built beside the rocky path which led into a pretty valley beyond, Ozma asked a man: \"Are you happy?",
  "Have you any complaint to make of your lot?\" And the man replied: \"We are happy except for three mischievous Imps that live in yonder valley and often come here to annoy us. If your Highness would only drive away those Imps, I and my family would be very happy and very grateful to you.\"",
  "If strangers pass through the valley the Imps jeer at them and make horrid faces and call names, and often they push travelers out of the path or throw stones at them. Whenever Imp Olite or Imp Udent or Imp Ertinent comes here to bother us, I and my family run into the house and lock all the doors and windows, and we dare not venture out again until the Imps have gone away.\"",
  "Princess Ozma was grieved to hear this report and the little Wizard shook his head gravely and said the naughty Imps deserved to be punished. They told the good man they would see what could be done to protect him and at once entered the valley to seek the dwelling place of the three mischievous creatures.",
  "Before long they came upon three caves, hollowed from the rocks, and in front of each cave squatted a queer little dwarf. Ozma and the Wizard paused to examine them and found them well-shaped, strong and lively. They had big round ears, flat noses and wide grinning mouths, and their jet-black hair came to points on top of their heads, much resembling horns.",
  "Their clothing fitted snugly to their bodies and limbs and the Imps were so small in size that at first Ozma did not consider them at all dangerous. But one of them suddenly reached out a hand and caught the dress of the Princess, jerking it so sharply that she nearly fell down, and a moment later another Imp pushed the little Wizard so hard that he bumped against Ozma and both unexpectedly sat down upon the ground. At this the Imps laughed boisterously and began running around in a circle and kicking dust upon the Royal Princess, who cried in a sharp voice: \"Wizard, do your duty!\"",
  "The Wizard promptly obeyed. Without rising from the ground he opened his bag, got the tools he required and muttered a magic spell. Instantly the three Imps became three bushes—of a thorny stubby kind—with their roots in the ground. As the bushes were at first motionless, perhaps through surprise at their sudden transformation, the Wizard and the Princess found time to rise from the ground and brush the dust off their pretty clothes.",
  "Then Ozma turned to the bushes and said: \"The unhappy lot you now endure, my poor Imps, is due entirely to your naughty actions. You can no longer annoy harmless travelers and you must remain ugly bushes, covered with sharp thorns, until you repent of your bad ways and promise to be good Imps.\" \"They can't help being good now, your Highness,\" said the Wizard, who was much pleased with his work, \"and the safest plan will be to allow them always to remain bushes.\"",
  "But something must have been wrong with the Wizard's magic, or the creatures had magic of their own, for no sooner were the words spoken than the bushes began to move. At first they only waved their branches at the girl and little man, but pretty soon they began to slide over the ground, their roots dragging through the earth, and one pushed itself against the Wizard and pricked him so sharply with its thorns that he cried out: \"Ouch!\" and started to run away.",
  "Ozma followed, for the other bushes were trying to stick their thorns into her legs and one actually got so near her that it tore a great rent in her beautiful dress. The girl Princess could run, however, and she followed the fleeing Wizard until he tumbled head first over a log and rolled upon the ground.",
  "Then she sprang behind a tree and shouted: \"Quick! Transform them into something else.\" The Wizard heard, but he was much confused by his fall. Grabbing from his bag the first magical tool he could find he transformed the bushes into three white pigs. That astonished the Imps. In the shape of pigs—fat, roly-poly and cute—they scampered off a little distance and sat down to think about their new condition.",
  "However, unless the horrid creatures behave themselves hereafter, they are liable to be killed and eaten. They would make good chops, sausages or roasts.\" But the Imps were now angry and had no intention of behaving. As Ozma and the little Wizard turned to resume their journey, the three pigs rushed forward, dashed between their legs, and tripped them up, so that both lost their balance and toppled over, clinging to one another. As the Wizard tried to get up he was tripped again and fell across the back of the third pig, which carried him on a run far down the valley until it dumped the little man in the river. Ozma had been sprawled upon the ground but found she was not hurt, so she picked herself up and ran to the assistance of the Wizard, reaching him just as he was crawling out of the river, gasping for breath and dripping with water.",
  "The girl could not help laughing at his woeful appearance. But he had no sooner wiped the wet from his eyes than one of the impish pigs tripped him again and sent him into the river for a second bath. The pigs tried to trip Ozma, too, but she ran around a stump and so managed to keep out of their way.",
  "So the Wizard scrambled out of the water again and picked up a sharp stick to defend himself. Then he mumbled a magic mutter which instantly dried his clothes, after which he hurried to assist Ozma. The pigs were afraid of the sharp stick and kept away from it. \"This won't do,\" said the Princess.",
  "The Wizard took time to think. Then he transformed the white pigs into three blue doves. \"Doves,\" said he, \"are the most harmless things in the world.\" But scarcely had he spoken when the doves flew at them and tried to peck out their eyes. When they endeavored to shield their eyes with their hands, two of the doves bit the Wizard's fingers and another caught the pretty pink ear of the Princess in its bill and gave it such a cruel tweak that she cried out in pain and threw her skirt over her head.",
  "The Wizard was pretty busy, just then, driving off the birds, but he managed to open his bag of magic and find a charm which instantly transformed the doves into three buttons. As they fell to the ground he picked them up and smiled with satisfaction. The tin button was Imp Olite, the brass button was Imp Udent and the lead button was Imp Ertinent.",
  "These buttons the Wizard placed in a little box which he put in his jacket pocket. \"Now,\" said he, \"the Imps cannot annoy travelers, for we shall carry them back with us to the Emerald City.\" \"But we dare not use the buttons,\" said Ozma, smiling once more now that the danger was over.",
  "Then they will decide to be very good in the future. When they feel that way, the tin button will turn to silver and the brass to gold, while the lead button will become aluminum. I shall then restore them to their proper forms, changing their names to pretty names instead of the ugly ones they used to bear.",
  "Thereafter the three Imps will become good citizens of the Land of Oz and I think you will find they will prove faithful subjects of our beloved Princess Ozma.\" \"Ah, that is magic well worthwhile,\" exclaimed Ozma, well pleased. \"There is no doubt, my friend, but that you are a very clever Wizard.\"",
  "JACK PUMPKINHEAD AND THE SA WHORSE N a room of the Royal Palace of the Emerald City of Oz hangs a Magic Picture, in which are shown all the important scenes that transpire in those fairy dominions. The scenes shift constantly and by watching them, Ozma, the girl Ruler, is able to discover events taking place in any part of her kingdom.",
  "One day she saw in her Magic Picture that a little girl and a little boy had wandered together into a great, gloomy forest at the far west of Oz and had become hopelessly lost. Their friends were seeking them in the wrong direction and unless Ozma came to their rescue the little ones would never be found in time to save them from starving.",
  "So the Princess sent a message to Jack Pumpkinhead and asked him to come to the palace. This personage, one of the queerest of the queer inhabitants of Oz, was an old friend and companion of Ozma. His form was made of rough sticks fitted together and dressed in ordinary clothes.",
  "His head was a pumpkin with a face carved upon it, and was set on top a sharp stake which formed his neck. Jack was active, good-natured and a general favorite; but his pumpkin head was likely to spoil with age, so in order to secure a good supply of heads he grew a big field of pumpkins and lived in the middle of it, his house being a huge pumpkin hollowed out. Whenever he needed a new head he picked a pumpkin, carved a face on it and stuck it upon the stake of his neck, throwing away the old head as of no further use.",
  "The day Ozma sent for him Jack was in prime condition and was glad to be of service in rescuing the lost children. Ozma made him a map, showing just where the forest was and how to get to it and the paths he must take to reach the little ones.",
  "This remarkable animal was not unlike Jack Pumpkinhead in form, although so different in shape. Its body was a log, with four sticks stuck into it for legs. A branch at one end of the log served as a tail, while in the other end was chopped a gash that formed a mouth.",
  "Above this were two small knots that did nicely for eyes. The Sawhorse was the favorite steed of Ozma and to prevent its wooden legs from wearing out she had them shod with plates of gold. Jack said \"Good morning\" to the Sawhorse and placed upon the creature's back a saddle of purple leather, studded with jewels.",
  "Then he climbed into the saddle and the wooden animal pranced out of the stable, through the streets of the Emerald City and out upon the highway leading to the western forest where the children were lost. Small though he was, the Sawhorse was swift and untiring. By nightfall they were in the far west and quite close to the forest they sought.",
  "They passed the night standing quietly by the roadside. They needed no food, for their wooden bodies never became hungry; nor did they sleep, because they never tired. At daybreak they continued their journey and soon reached the forest. Jack now examined the map Ozma had given him and found the right path to take, which the Sawhorse obediently followed.",
  "The paths branched so many times and in so many different ways that the Pumpkinhead was often obliged to consult Ozma's map, and finally the Sawhorse became suspicious. \"Are you sure you are right?\" it asked. \"Of course,\" answered Jack. \"Even a Pumpkinhead whose brains are seeds can follow so clear a map as this.",
  "Every path is plainly marked, and here is a cross where the children are.\" Finally they reached a place, in the very heart of the forest, where they came upon the lost boy and girl. But they found the two children bound fast to the trunk of a big tree, at the foot of which they were sitting.",
  "But why are you bound to that tree?\" \"Because,\" cried a small, sharp voice, \"they are thieves and robbers. That's why!\" \"Dear me!\" said Jack, looking around to see who had spoken. The voice seemed to come from above. A big grey squirrel was sitting upon a low branch of the tree.",
  "Upon the squirrel's head was a circle of gold, with a diamond set in the center of it. He was running up and down the limbs and chattering excitedly. \"These children,\" continued the squirrel, angrily, \"robbed our storehouse of all the nuts we had saved up for winter. Therefore, being King of all the Squirrels in this forest, I ordered them arrested and put in prison, as you now see them.",
  "We didn't want to starve when there was food right in front of us.\" \"Quite right,\" remarked Jack, nodding his pumpkin head. \"I don't blame you one bit, under the circumstances. Not a bit.\" Then he began to untie the ropes that bound the children to the tree. \"Stop that!\" cried the King Squirrel, chattering and whisking about.",
  "You have no right to.\" But Jack paid no attention to the protest. His wooden fingers were awkward and it took him some time to untie the ropes. When at last he succeeded, the tree was full of squirrels, called together by their King, and they were furious at losing their prisoners.",
  "Now, at the top of this tree was a big dead limb, and so many squirrels gathered upon it that suddenly it broke away and fell to the ground. Poor Jack was standing directly under it and when the limb struck him it smashed his pumpkin head into a pulpy mass and sent Jack's wooden form tumbling, to stop with a bump against a tree a dozen feet away.",
  "He sat up, a moment afterward, but when he felt for his head it was gone. He could not see; neither could he speak. It was perhaps the greatest misfortune that could have happened to Jack Pumpkinhead, and the squirrels were delighted. They danced around in the tree in great glee as they saw Jack's plight.",
  "The boy and girl were indeed free, but their protector was ruined. The Sawhorse was there, however, and in his way he was wise. He had seen the accident and knew that the smashed pumpkin would never again serve Jack as a head. So he said to the children, who were frightened at this accident to their new found friend: \"Pick up the Pumpkinhead's body and set it on my saddle.",
  "Then mount behind it and hold on. We must get out of this forest as soon as we can, or the squirrels may capture you again. I must guess at the right path, for Jack's map is no longer of any use to him since that limb destroyed his head.\"",
  "The two children lifted Jack's body, which was not at all heavy, and placed it upon the saddle. Then they climbed up behind it and the Sawhorse immediately turned and trotted back along the path he had come, bearing all three with ease. However, when the path began to branch into many paths, all following different directions, the wooden animal became puzzled and soon was wandering aimlessly about, without any hope of finding the right way.",
  "Toward evening they came upon a fine fruit tree, which furnished the children a supper, and at night the little ones lay upon a bed of leaves while the Sawhorse stood watch, with the limp, headless form of poor Jack Pumpkinhead lying helpless across the saddle. Now, Ozma had seen in her Magic Picture all that had happened in the forest, so she sent the little Wizard, mounted upon the Cowardly Lion, to save the unfortunates. The Lion knew the forest well and when he reached it he bounded straight through the tangled paths to where the Sawhorse was wandering, with Jack and the two children on his back.",
  "The Wizard was grieved at the sight of the headless Jack, but believed he could save him. He first led the Sawhorse out of the forest and restored the boy and girl to the arms of their anxious friends, and then he sent the Lion back to Ozma to tell her what had happened.",
  "The Wizard now mounted the Sawhorse and supported Jack's form on the long ride to the pumpkin field. When they arrived at Jack's house the Wizard selected a fine pumpkin—not too ripe—and very neatly carved a face on it. Then he stuck the pumpkin solidly on Jack's neck and asked him: \"Well, old friend, how do you feel?\"",
  "But, to speak truly, my dear Sawhorse, Jack Pumpkinhead, with all his good qualities, will never be noted for his wisdom.\" THE SCARECROW AND THE TIN WOODMAN HERE lived in the Land of Oz two queerly made men who were the best of friends. They were so much happier when together that they were seldom apart; yet they liked to separate, once in a while, that they might enjoy the pleasure of meeting again.",
  "One was a Scarecrow. That means he was a suit of blue Munchkin clothes, stuffed with straw, on top of which was fastened a round cloth head, filled with bran to hold it in shape. On the head were painted two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth. The Scarecrow had never been much of a success in scaring crows, but he prided himself on being a superior man, because he could feel no pain, was never tired and did not have to eat or drink. His brains were sharp, for the Wizard of Oz had put pins and needles in the Scarecrow's brains.",
  "The other man was made all of tin, his arms and legs and head being cleverly jointed so that he could move them freely. He was known as the Tin Woodman, having at one time been a woodchopper, and everyone loved him because the Wizard had given him an excellent heart of red plush.",
  "The Tin Woodman lived in a magnificent tin castle, built on his country estate in the Winkie Land, not far from the Emerald City of Oz. It had pretty tin furniture and was surrounded by lovely gardens in which were many tin trees and beds of tin flowers. The palace of the Scarecrow was not far distant, on the banks of a river, and this palace was in the shape of an immense ear of corn.",
  "The sail was of purple silk and glittered gayly in the sunshine. There was a good breeze that day, so the boat glided swiftly over the water. By and by they came to a smaller river that flowed from out a deep forest, and the Tin Woodman proposed they sail up this stream, as it would be cool and shady beneath the trees of the forest.",
  "So the Scarecrow, who was steering, turned the boat up the stream and the friends continued talking together of old times and the wonderful adventures they had met with while traveling with Dorothy, the little Kansas girl. They became so much interested in this talk that they forgot to notice that the boat was now sailing through the forest, or that the stream was growing more narrow and crooked.",
  "Suddenly the Scarecrow glanced up and saw a big rock just ahead of them. \"Look out!\" he cried; but the warning came too late. The Tin Woodman sprang to his feet just as the boat bumped into the rock, and the jar made him lose his balance. He toppled and fell overboard and being made of tin he sank to the bottom of the water in an instant and lay there at full length, face up. Immediately the Scarecrow threw out the anchor, so as to hold the boat in that place, and then he leaned over the side and through the clear water looked at his friend sorrowfully.",
  "Meantime, the water is soaking into all my joints and I shall become badly rusted before I am rescued.\" \"Very true,\" agreed the Scarecrow; \"but be patient, my friend, and I'll dive down and get you. My straw will not rust, and is easily replaced, if damaged, so I'm not afraid of the water.\"",
  "The Scarecrow now took off his hat and made a dive from the boat into the water; but he was so light in weight that he barely dented the surface of the stream, nor could he reach the Tin Woodman with his outstretched straw arms. So he floated to the boat and climbed into it, saying the while:",
  "We have an extra anchor aboard, and I will tie it around my waist, to make me sink, and dive again.\" \"Don't do that!\" called the tin man. \"That would anchor you also to the bottom, where I am, and we'd both be helpless.\" \"True enough,\" sighed the Scarecrow, wiping his wet face with a handkerchief; and then he gave a cry of astonishment, for he found he had wiped off one painted eye and now had but one eye to see with.",
  "I must be careful not to wipe off the other eye, for then I could not see to help you at all.\" A shriek of elfish laughter greeted this speech and looking up the Scarecrow found the trees full of black crows, who seemed much amused by the straw man's one-eyed",
  "He knew the crows well, however, and they had usually been friendly to him because he had never deceived them into thinking he was a meat man—the sort of man they really feared. \"Don't laugh,\" said he; \"you may lose an eye yourselves some day.\" \"We couldn't look as funny as you, if we did,\" replied one old crow, the king of them.",
  "I've tried it, and knocked one eye out.\" \"Can't you fish for him?\" \"Ah, that is a good idea,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I'll make the attempt.\" He found a fishline in the boat, with a stout hook at the end of it. No bait was needed, so the Scarecrow dropped the hook into the water till it touched the Woodman.",
  "The Scarecrow tried to do this, but having only one eye he could not see the joints very clearly. \"Hurry up, please,\" begged the Tin Woodman; \"you've no idea how damp it is down here.\" \"Can't you help?\" asked the crow. \"How?\" inquired the tin man. \"Catch the line and hook it around your neck.\" The Tin Woodman made the attempt and after several trials wound the line around his neck and hooked it securely.",
  "At once the air was filled with black crows, each of whom seized the cord with beak or talons. The Scarecrow watched them with much interest and forgot that he had tied the other end of the line around his own waist, so he would not lose it while fishing for his friend.",
  "The Scarecrow clapped his stuffed hands in glee as he saw his friend drawn from the water into the air; but the next moment the straw man was himself in the air, his stuffed legs kicking wildly; for the crows had flown straight up through the trees. On one end of the line dangled the Tin Woodman, hung by the neck, and on the other dangled the Scarecrow, hung by the waist and clinging fast to the spare anchor of the boat, which he had seized hoping to save himself.",
  "But the crows were bent on mischief. They thought it a good joke to bother the two, now that they held them captive. \"Here's where the crows scare the Scarecrow!\" chuckled the naughty King Crow, and at his command the birds flew over the forest to where a tall dead tree stood higher than all the other trees.",
  "At the very top was a crotch, formed by two dead limbs, and into the crotch the crows dropped the center of the line. Then, letting go their hold, they flew away, chattering with laughter, and left the two friends suspended high in the air—one on each side of the tree.",
  "Now the Tin Woodman was much heavier than the Scarecrow, but the reason they balanced so nicely was because the straw man still clung fast to the iron anchor. There they hung, not ten feet apart, yet unable to reach the bare tree-trunk. \"For goodness sake don't drop that anchor,\" said the Tin Woodman anxiously.",
  "Also you would shoot into the air and alight somewhere among the tree-tops.\" \"Then,\" said the Scarecrow, earnestly, \"I shall hold fast to the anchor.\" For a time they both dangled in silence, the breeze swaying them gently to and fro. Finally the tin man said: \"Here is an emergency, friend, where only brains can help us.",
  "We must think of some way to escape.\" \"I'll do the thinking,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"My brains are the sharpest.\" He thought so long that the tin man grew tired and tried to change his position, but found his joints had already rusted so badly that he could not move them.",
  "And his oil- can was back in the boat. \"Do you suppose your brains are rusted, friend Scarecrow?\" he asked in a weak voice, for his jaws would scarcely move. \"No, indeed. Ah, here's an idea at last!\" And with this the Scarecrow clapped his hands to his head, forgetting the anchor, which tumbled to the ground. The result was astonishing; for, just as the tin man had said, the light Scarecrow flew into the air, sailed over the top of the tree and landed in a bramble-bush, while the tin man fell plump to the ground, and landing on a bed of dry leaves was not dented at all. The Tin Woodman's joints were so rusted, however, that he was unable to move, while the thorns held the Scarecrow a fast prisoner.",
  "While they were in this sad plight the sound of hoofs was heard and along the forest path rode the little Wizard of Oz, seated on a wooden Sawhorse. He smiled when he saw the one-eyed head of the Scarecrow sticking out of the bramble-bush, but he helped the poor straw man out of his prison.",
  "Together they ran to the river bank, but the boat was floating in midstream and the Wizard was obliged to mumble some magic words to draw it to the bank, so the Scarecrow could get the oil-can. Then back they flew to the tin man, and while the Scarecrow carefully oiled each joint the little Wizard moved the joints gently back and forth until they worked freely.",
  "After an hour of this labor the Tin Woodman was again on his feet, and although still a little stiff he managed to walk to the boat. The Wizard and the Sawhorse also got aboard the corncob craft and together they returned to the Scarecrow's palace. But the Tin Woodman was very careful not to stand up in the boat again.",

  "LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD There was once a sweet little maid who lived with her father and mother in a pretty little cottage at the edge of the village. At the further end of the wood was another pretty cottage and in it lived her grandmother . Everybody loved this little girl, her grandmother perhaps loved her most of all and gave her a great many pretty things.",
  "Once she gave her a red cloak with a hood which she always wore, so people called her Little Red Riding Hood. One morning Little Red Riding Hood's mother said, \"Put on your things and go to see your grandmother . She has been ill; take along this basket for her .",
  "I have put in it eggs, butter and cake, and other dainties.\" It was a bright and sunny morning. Red Riding Hood was so happy that at first she wanted to dance through the wood. All around her grew pretty wild flowers which she loved so well and she stopped to pick a bunch for her grandmother .",
  "Little Red Riding Hood wandered from her path and was stooping to pick a flower when from behind her a gruf f voice said, \"Good morning, Little Red Riding Hood.\" Little Red Riding Hood turned around and saw a great big wolf, but Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked beast the wolf was, so she was not afraid. \"What have you in that basket, Little Red Riding Hood?\"",
  "Wolf.\" \"Where are you going with them, Little Red Riding Hood?\" \"I am going to my grandmother , who is ill, Mr . Wolf.\" \"Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?\" \"Along that path, past the wild rose bushes, then through the gate at the end of the wood, Mr .",
  "Wolf.\" Then Mr . Wolf again said \"Good morning\" and set of f, and Little Red Riding Hood again went in search of wild flowers. At last he reached the porch covered with flowers and knocked at the door of the cottage. \"Who is there?\" called the grandmother . \"Little Red Riding Hood,\" said the wicked wolf.",
  "The wolf pressed the latch, and walked in where the grandmother lay in bed. He made one jump at her , but she jumped out of bed into a closet. Then the wolf put on the cap which she had dropped and crept under the bedclothes. In a short while Little Red Riding Hood knocked at the door , and walked in, saying, \"Good morning, Grandmother , I have brought you eggs, butter and cake, and here is a bunch of flowers I gathered in the wood.\" As she came nearer the bed she said, \"What big ears you have, Grandmother .\"",
  "Just at that moment Little Red Riding Hood's father was passing the cottage and heard her scream. He rushed in and with his axe chopped of f Mr. Wolf's head. Everybody was happy that Little Red Riding Hood had escaped the wolf. Then Little Red Riding Hood's father carried her home and they lived happily ever after .",
  "She also sent a Waiting-woman with her . When the hour of departure came they bade each other a sorrowful farewell and set out for the bridegroom's country . When they had ridden for a time the Princess became very thirsty , and said to the Waiting-woman, \"Go down and fetch me some water in my cup from the stream.",
  "I must have something to drink.\" \"If you are thirsty ,\" said the Waiting-woman, \"dismount yourself, lie down by the water and drink. I don't choose to be your servant.\" Being very thirsty , the Princess dismounted, and knelt by the flowing water . Now , when she was about to mount her horse again, the Waiting-woman said, \"By rights your horse belongs to me; this jade will do for you!\"",
  "The poor little Princess was obliged to give way. Then the Waiting-woman, in a harsh voice, ordered her to take of f her royal robes, and to put on her own mean garments. Finally she forced her to swear that she would not tell a person at the Court what had taken place. Had she not taken the oath she would have been killed on the spot.",
  "There was great rejoicing when they arrived at the castle. The Prince hurried towards them, and lifted the Waiting-woman from her horse, thinking she was his bride. She was led upstairs, but the real Princess had to stay below . The old King looked out of the window and saw the delicate, pretty little creature standing in the courtyard; so he asked the bride about her companion.",
  "Give the girl something to do to keep her from idling.\" The old King said, \"I have a little lad who looks after the geese; she may help him.\" The boy was called little Conrad, and the real bride was sent with him to look after the geese. When they reached the meadow , the Princess sat down on the grass and let down her hair , and when Conrad saw it he was so delighted that he wanted to pluck some out; but she said— \"Blow , blow , little breeze, And Conrad's hat seize.",
  "Let him join in the chase While away it is whirled, Till my tresses are curled And I rest in my place.\" Then a strong wind sprang up, which blew away Conrad's hat right over the fields, and he had to run after it. When he came back her hair was all put up again.",
  "When they got home Conrad went to the King and said, \"I won't tend the geese with that maiden again.\" \"Why not?\" asked the King. Then Conrad went on to tell the King all that had happened in the field. The King ordered Conrad to go next day as usual and he followed into the field and hid behind a bush. He saw it happen just as Conrad had told him.",
  "Thereupon he went away unnoticed; and in the evening, when the Goose-girl came home, he asked her why she did all these things. \"That I may not tell you,\" she answered. Then he said, \"If you won't tell me, then tell the iron stove there;\" and he went away .",
  "She crept up to the stove and unburdened her heart to it. The King stood outside by the pipes of the stove and heard all she said. Then he came back, and caused royal robes to be put upon her , and her beauty was a marvel. Then he called his son and told him that he had a false bride, but that the true bride was here.",
  "The Prince was charmed with her beauty and a great banquet was prepared. The bridegroom sat at the head of the table, with the Princess on one side and the Waiting-woman at the other; but she did not recognize the Princess. When they had eaten, the King put a riddle to the Waiting-woman.",
  "The false bride answered, \"He must be put into a barrel and dragged along by two white horses till he is dead.\" \"That is your doom,\" said the King, \"and the judgment shall be carried out.\" When the sentence was fulfilled, the young Prince married his true bride, and they lived together in peace and happiness.",
  "BABES IN THE WOOD Once upon a time there lived two little children whose parents were ill unto death. They begged their brother to care for the two little ones as he would his own. The uncle promised he would be a father to them, but he soon began to scheme to possess the money the parents had left in his care for the children.",
  "He sent for two robbers and bar gained with them to take the two babes into the woods and kill them. After going many miles into the woods one of the robbers said, \"Let us not kill the little children, they never harmed us.\" The other robber would not consent, so they came to blows.",
  "This frightened the children so much that they ran away and did not see the robbers again. They wandered on and on until they became so tired and hungry that at length they sat down at the foot of a tree and cried as if their hearts would break. The little birds heard them and began to trill sweet lullabies, which presently lulled them to rest. The birdies knew that the children would die of cold and hunger , so they covered them with leaves of crimson and brown and green.",
  "They then told the angels in Heaven the sad story of the lost babes, and one of the white-robed angels flew down to earth and carried both the little ones back to Heaven, so that when they awoke they were no longer tired and hungry , but were again with their dear mother .",
  "THE SLEEPING BEAUTY Once upon a time there was a king and queen who for a very long time had no children, and when at length a little daughter was born to them they were so pleased that they gave a christening feast to which they invited a number of fairies. But, unfortunately , they left out one rather cross old fairy , and she was so angry that she said the princess should die when she reached the age of sixteen, by pricking her hand with a spindle. All the other fairies present, except one, had already given the princess their beautiful gifts, and this last one said she could not prevent part of the wicked wish coming true; but her gift should be that the princess should not really die, but only fall into a deep sleep, which should last for a hundred years, and at the end of that time she should be awakened by a king's son.",
  "It all happened as the fairies had predicted. When the princess was sixteen years old she saw an old woman spinning and took the spindle from her to try this strange new work. Instantly she pricked her hand and fell into a deep sleep, as did everyone else in the palace.",
  "There she lay in a bower of roses, year after year , and the hedge around the palace garden grew so tall and thick that at last you could not have told that there was a castle at all. At the end of the hundred years a king's son heard of the castle and the enchanted princess who lay asleep there and determined to rescue her .",
  "So he cut his way through the thick prickly hedge and at length he came to the princess. When he saw how lovely and how sweet she looked he fell in love with her and, stooping, kissed her lips. At once she awoke and with her the king and queen and all the courtiers, who had fallen asleep at the same time.",
  "SNOWDROP AND SEVEN LITTLE DW ARFS Once upon a time there was a little princess called Snowdrop, who had a cruel step-mother who was jealous of her . The Queen had a magic mirror , which could speak to her , and when she looked into it and asked who was the fairest lady in the land the mirror told her she was, for she was very beautiful; but as Snowdrop grew up she became still more lovely than her step-mother and the mirror did not fail to tell the Queen this. So she ordered one of her huntsmen to take Snowdrop away and kill her; but he was too tender -hearted to do this and left the maiden in the wood and went home again. Snowdrop wandered about until she came to the house of seven little dwarfs, and they were so kind as to take her in and let her live with them. She used to make their seven little beds, and prepare the meals for the seven little men, and they were all quite happy until the Queen found out from her mirror that Snowdrop was alive still, for , as it always told the truth, it still told her Snowdrop was the fairest lady in the land.",
  "She decided that Snowdrop must die, so she dyed her face and dressed up like an old pedlar , and in this disguise she went to the home of the seven Dwarfs and called out, \"Laces for sale.\" Snowdrop peeped out of the window and said, \"Good-day , mother; what have you to sell?\"",
  "Snowdrop opened the door and bought the pretty lace. \"Child,\" said the old woman, \"you are a sight, let me lace you properly for once.\" Snowdrop placed herself before the old woman, who laced her so quickly and so tightly that she took away Snowdrop's breath and she fell down as though dead. Not long after the seven dwarfs came home they found that she was laced too tight and cut the lace, whereupon Snowdrop began to breathe and soon came back to life again. When the Queen got home and found by asking her mirror that Snowdrop was still alive, she planned to make an end of her for good, so she made a poisoned comb and disguised herself to look like a dif ferent old woman. She journeyed to the dwarfs' home and induced Snowdrop to let her comb her hair . The minute she put the poisoned comb in her hair Snowdrop fell down as though dead. When the seven dwarfs came home they found their poor Snowdrop on the floor , and suspecting the bad Queen began to look for the cause, soon finding the comb.",
  "No sooner had they removed it than Snowdrop came to life again. Upon the Queen's return home she found by asking her mirror that Snowdrop still lived, so she disguised herself a third time and came to the dwarfs' little house and gave Snowdrop a poisoned apple. As soon as the little princess took a bite it stuck in her throat and choked her .",
  "Oh! how grieved were the good little dwarfs. They made a fine glass cof fin, and put Snowdrop into it and were carrying her away to bury her when they met a prince, who fell in love with the little dead maiden, and begged the dwarfs to give her to him.",
  "The dwarfs were so sorry for him they consented, and the prince's servants were about to carry the cof fin away when they stumbled and fell over the root of a tree. Snowdrop received such a violent jerk that the poisonous apple was jerked right out of her throat and she sat up alive and well again.",
  "Of course she married the prince, and she, her husband and the good little dwarfs lived happily ever after , but the cruel step-mother came to a bad end, and no one was even sorry for her . *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK CHILDREN'S HOUR WITH RED RIDING HOOD AND OTHER STORIES *** Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.",

  "ITHE FROG PRINCE. N the olden time, when wishing was having , there lived a King, whose daughters were all beautiful; but the youngest was so exceedingly beautiful that the Sun himself, although he saw her very often, was enchanted every time she came out into the sunshine. Near the castle of this King was a large and gloomy forest, and in the midst stood an old lime-tree, beneath whose branches splashed a little fountain; so, whenever it was very hot, the King's youngest daughter ran off into this wood, and sat down by the side of this fountain; and, when she felt dull, would often divert herself by throwing a golden ball up in the air and catching it.",
  "And this was her favourite amusement. Now , one day it happened, that this golden ball, when the King's daughter threw it into the air, did not fall down into her hand, but on the grass; and then it rolled past her into the fountain. The King's daughter followed the ball with her eyes, but it disappeared beneath the water , which was so deep that no one could see to the bottom.",
  "Then she began to lament, and to cry louder and louder; and, as she cried, a voice called out, \"Why weepest thou, O King's daughter? thy tears would melt even a stone to pity.\" And she looked around to the spot whence the voice came, and saw a Frog stretching his thick ugly head out of the water .",
  "But what wilt thou give me if I fetch thy plaything up again?\" \"What will you have, dear Frog?\" said she. \"My dresses, my pearls and jewels, or the golden crown which I wear?\" The Frog answered, \"Dresses, or jewels, or golden crowns, are not for me; but if thou wilt love me, and let me be thy companion and playf ellow , and sit at thy table, and eat from thy little golden plate, and drink out of thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,—if thou wilt promise me all these, then will I dive down and fetch up thy golden ball.\"",
  "But she thought to herself, \"What is the silly Frog chattering about? Let him remain in the water with his equals; he cannot mix in society .\" But the Frog, as soon as he had received her promise, drew his head under the water and dived down. Presently he swam up again with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the grass.",
  "The King's daughter was full of joy when she again saw her beautiful plaything; and, taking it up, she ran off immediately . \"Stop! stop!\" cried the Frog; \"take me with thee. I cannot run as thou canst.\" But all his croaking was useless; although it was loud enough, the King's daughter did not hear it, but, hastening home, soon for got the poor Frog, who was obliged to leap back into the fountain. The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with her father and all his courtiers, and was eating from her own little golden plate, something was heard coming up the marble stairs, splish- splash, splish-splash; and when it arrived at the top, it knocked at the door, and a voice said, \"Open the door, thou youngest daughter of the King!\" So she rose and went to see who it was that called her; but when she opened the door and caught sight of the Frog, she shut it again with great vehemence, and sat down at the table, looking very pale. But the King perceived that her heart was beating violently , and asked her whether it were a giant who had come to fetch her away who stood at the door.",
  "I never thought that he could come out of the water , but somehow he has jumped out, and now he wants to come in here.\" At that moment there was another knock, and a voice said,— \"King's daughter, youngest, Open the door. Hast thou forgotten Thy promises made At the fountain so clear 'Neath the lime-tree's shade?",
  "King's daughter, youngest, Open the door.\" Then the King said, \"What you have promised, that you must perform; go and let him in.\" So the King's daughter went and opened the door, and the Frog hopped in after her right up to her chair: and as soon as she was seated, the Frog said, \"Take me up;\" but she hesitated so long that at last the King ordered her to obey . And as soon as the Frog sat on the chair , he jumped on to the table, and said, \"Now push thy plate near me, that we may eat together .\"",
  "And she did so, but as everyone saw, very unwillingly . The Frog seemed to relish his dinner much, but every bit that the King's daughter ate nearly choked her, till at last the Frog said, \"I have satisfied my hunger and feel very tired; wilt thou carry me upstairs now into thy chamber , and make thy bed ready that we may sleep toget her?\" At this speech the King's daughter began to cry, for she was afraid of the cold Frog, and dared not touch him; and besides, he actually wanted to sleep in her own beautiful, clean bed. But her tears only made the King very angry , and he said,\" He who helped you in the time of your trouble, must not now be despised!\"",
  "So she took the Frog up with two fingers, and put him in a corner of her chamber . But as she lay in her bed, he crept up to it, and said, \"I am so very tired that I shall sleep well; do take me up or I will tell thy father .\"",
  "This speech put the King's daughter in a terrible passion, and catching the Frog up, she threw him with all her strength against the wall, saying, \"Now , will you be quiet, you ugly Frog?\" But as he fell he was changed from a frog into a handsome Prince with beautiful eyes, who, after a little while became, with her father's consent, her dear companion and betrothed.",
  "The next morning, as soon as the sun rose, a carriage drawn by eight white horses, with ostrich feathers on their heads, and golden bridles, drove up to the door of the palace, and behind the carriage stood the trusty Henry , the servant of the young Prince. When his master was changed into a frog, trusty Henry had grieved so much that he had bound three iron bands round his heart, for fear it should break with grief and sorrow .",
  "But now that the carriage was ready to carry the young Prince to his own country , the faithful Henry helped in the bride and bridegroom, and placed himself in the seat behind, full of joy at his master's release. They had not proceeded far when the Prince heard a crack as if somet hing had broken behind the carriage; so he put his head out of the window and asked Henry what was broken, and Henry answered, \"It was not the carriage, my master , but a band which I bound round my heart when it was in such grief because you were changed into a frog.\" Twice afterwards on the journey there was the same noise, and each time the Prince thought that it was some part of the carriage that had given way; but it was only the breaking of the bands which bound the heart of the trusty Henry , who was thenceforward free and happy .",
  "Ocalled and asked for a dinner , as this Princess was an excellent cook. After the meal was over, the old woman, who was a fairy, promised that their kindness should be rewarded, and immediately disappeared. Shortly after, the King came that way, with his brother and the Lord Admiral. They were all so struck with the beauty of the three Princesses, that the King married the youngest, Blondine, his brother married Brunette, and the Lord Admiral married Roussette. The good Fairy , who had brought all this about, also caused the young Queen Blondine to have three lovely children, two boys and a girl, out of whose hair fell fine jewels.",
  "Each had a brilliant star on the forehead, and a rich chain of gold around the neck. At the same time Brunette, her sister , gave birth to a handsome boy. Now the young Queen and Brunette were much attached to each other , but Roussette was jealous of both, and the old Queen , the King's mother , hated them. Brunette died soon after the birth of her son, and the King was absent on a warlike expedition, so Roussett e joined the wicked old Queen in forming plans to injure Blondine.",
  "They ordered Feintise, the old Queen's waiting-woman, to strangle the Queen's three children and the son of Princess Brunette, and bury them secretly . But as she was about to execute this wicked order , she was so struck by their beauty , and the appearance of the sparkling stars on their foreheads, that she shrank from the deed.",
  "So she had a boat brought round to the beach, and put the four babes, with some strings of jewels, into a cradle, which she placed in the boat, and then set it adrift. The boat was soon far out at sea. The waves rose, the rain poured in torrents, and the thunder roared.",
  "Feintise could not doubt that the boat would be swamped, and felt relieved by the thought that the poor little innocen ts would perish, for she would otherwise always be haunted by the fear that something would occur to betray the share she had had in their preservation. But the good Fairy protected them, and after floating at sea for seven days they were picked up by a Corsair .",
  "He was so struck by their beauty that he altered his course, and took them home to his wife, who had no children. She was transported with joy when he placed them in her hands. They admired together the wonderful stars, the chains of gold that could not be taken off their necks, and their long",
  "Much greater was the woman's astonishment when she combed them, for at every instant there rolled out of their hair pearls, rubies, diamonds, and emeralds. She told her husband of it, who was not less surprised than herself. \"I am very tired,\" said he, \"of a Corsair's life, and if the locks of those little children continue to supply us with such treasures, I will give up roaming the seas.\"",
  "The Corsair's wife, whose name was Corsine, was enchanted at this, and loved the four infants so much the more for it. She named the Princess, Belle-Etoile, her eldest brother , Petit-Soleil, the second, Heureux, and the son of Brunette, Cheri. As they grew older , the Corsair applied himself seriously to their education, as he felt convinced there was some great mystery attached to their birth.",
  "The Corsair and his wife had never told the story of the four children, who passe d for their own. They were exceedingly united, but Prince Cheri entertained for Princess Belle-Etoile a greater affection than the other two. The moment she expressed a wish for anything, he would attempt even impossibilities to gratify her .",
  "One day Belle-Etoile overheard the Corsair and his wife talking. \"When I fell in with them,\" said the Corsair , \"I saw nothing that could give me any idea of their birth.\" \"I suspect,\" said Corsine, \"that Cheri is not their brother , he has neither star nor neck-chain.\" Belle-Etoile immediately ran and told this to the three Princes, who resolved to speak to the Corsair and his wife, and ask them to let them set out to discover the secret of their birth.",
  "After some remonstrance they gained their consent. A beautiful vessel was prepared, and the young Princess and the three Princes set out. They determined to sail to the very spot where the Corsair had found them, and made preparations for a grand sacrifice to the fairies, for their protection and guidance.",
  "They were about to immolate a turtle-dove, but the Princess saved its life, and let it fly. At this moment a syren issued from the water , and said, \"Cease your anxiety , let your vessel go where it will; land where it stops.\" The vessel now sailed more quickly . Suddenly they came in sight of a city so beautiful that they were anxious their vessel should enter the port. Their wishes were accomplished; they landed, and the shore in a moment was crowded with people, who had observed the magnificence of their ship.",
  "They ran and told the King the news, and as the grand terrace of the Palace looked out upon the sea-shore, he speedily repaired thither . The Princes, hearing the people say, \"There is the King,\" looked up, and made a profound obeisance. He looked earnestly at them, and was as much charmed by the Princess's beauty , as by the handso me mien of the young Princes.",
  "The King was so interested about these four children, that he went into the cham ber of the Queen, his mother , to tell her of the wonderful stars which shone upon their foreheads, and everything that he admired in them. She was thunderstruck at it, and was terribly afraid that Feinti se had betrayed her, and sent her secretary to enquire about them.",
  "What he told her of their ages confirm ed her suspicions. She sent for Feintise, and threatened to kill her. Feintise, half dead with terror , confessed all; but promised, if she spared her, that she would still find means to do away with them. The Queen was appeased; and, indeed, old Feintise did all she could for her own sake.",
  "Taking a guitar , she went and sat down opposite the Princess's window , and sang a song which Belle-Etoile thought so pretty that she invited her into her chamber . \"My fair child,\" said Feintise, \"Heaven has made you very lovely , but you yet want one thing —the dancing-water .",
  "If I had possessed it, you would not have seen a white hair upon my head, nor a wrinkle on my face. Alas! I knew this secret too late; my charms had already faded.\" \"But where shall I find this dancing-water?\" asked Belle-Etoile. \"It is in the luminous forest,\" said Feintise.",
  "The perfidious old woman retired, delighted at having been so successful. The Princes, returning from the chase, found Belle-Etoile engrossed by the advice of Feintise. Her anxiety about it was so apparent, that Cheri, who thought of nothing but pleasing her, soon found out the cause of it, and, in spite of her entreaties, he mounted his white horse, and set out in search of the dancing-water .",
  "The wicked Feintise was very anxious to know the result of her advice; and when she heard that Cheri had already set out, she was delighted, and reported to the Queen-Mother all that had passed. \"I admit, Madam,\" said she, \"that I can no longer doubt that they are the same four children: but one of the Princes is already gone to seek the dancing-water , and will no doubt perish in the attempt, and I shall find similar means to do away with all of them.\"",
  "The plan she had adopted with regard to Prince Cheri was one of the most certain, for the dancing- water was not easily to be obtained; it was so notorious from the misfortunes which occurred to all who sought it, that every one knew the road to it. He was eight days without taking any repose but in the woods.",
  "At the end of this period he began to suffer very much from the heat; but it was not the heat of the sun, and he did not know the cause of it, until from the top of a mountain he perceived the luminous forest; all the trees were burning without being consumed, and casting out flames to such a distance that the country around was a dry desert.",
  "At this terrible scene he descended, and more than once gave himself up for lost. As he approached this great fire he was ready to die with thirst; and perceiving a spring falling into a marble basin, he alighted from his horse, approached it, and stooped to take up some water in the little golden vase which he had brought with him, when he saw a turtle-dove drowning in the fountain.",
  "Cheri took pity on it, and saved it. \"My Lord Cheri,\" she said, \"I am not ungrateful; I can guide you to the dancing-water , which, without me, you could never obtain, as it rises in the middle of the forest, and can only be reached by going under ground.\"",
  "The Dove then flew away , and summoned a number of foxes, badgers, moles, snails, ants, and all sorts of creatures that burrow in the earth. Cheri got off his horse at the entrance of the subterranean passage they made for him, and groped his way after the kind Dove, which safely conducted him to the fountain.",
  "Old Feintise learned from her spies that Cheri had returned, and that the Princess, having washed her face with the dancing-water , had become more lovely than ever. Finding this, she lost no time in artfully making the Princess sigh for the wonderful singing-apple. Prince Cheri again found her unhappy , and again found out the cause, and once more set out on his white horse, leaving a letter for Belle-Etoile.",
  "In the meanwhile, the King did not forget the lovely children, and reproached them for never going to the Palace. They excused themselves by saying that their brother's absence prevented them. Prince Cheri at break of day perceived a handsome young man, from whom he learned where the singing-apple was to be found: but after travelling some time without seeing any sign of it, he saw a poor turtle-dove fall at his feet almost dead.",
  "He took pity on it, and restored it, when it said, \"Good-day , handsome Cheri, you are destined to save my life, and I to do you signal service. You are come to seek for the singing-apple: it is guarded by a terrible dragon.\" The Dove then led him to a place where he found a suit of armour , all of glass: and by her advice he put it on, and boldly went to meet the dragon.",
  "The two-headed monster came bounding along, fire issuing from his throat; but when he saw his alarming figure multiplied in the Prince's mirrors he was frightened in his turn. He stopped, and looking fiercely at the Prince, apparently laden with dragons, he took flight and threw himself into a deep chasm.",
  "The Prince then found the tree, which was surrounded with human bones, and breaking off an apple, prepared to return to the Princess. She had never slept during his absence, and ran to meet him eagerly . When the wicked Feintise heard the sweet singing of the apple, her grief was excessive, for instead of doing harm to these lovely children, she only did them good by her perfidious counsels. She allowed some days to pass by without showing herself; and then once more made the Princess unhappy by saying that the dancing-water and the singing-apple were useless without the little green bird that tells everything.",
  "Cheri again set out, and after some trouble learnt that this bird was to be found on the top of a frightful rock, in a frozen climate. At length, at dawn of day, he perceived the rock, which was very high and very steep, and upon the summ it of it was the bird, speaking like an oracle, telling wonderful",
  "He thought that with a little dexterity it would be easy to catch it, for it seemed very tame. He got off his horse, and climbed up very quietly . He was so close to the green bird that he thought he could lay hands on it, when suddenly the rock opened and he fell into a spacio us hall, and became as motionless as a statue; he could neither stir, nor utter a complaint at his deplorable situation.",
  "Three hundred knights, who had made the same attempt, were in the same state. To look at each other was the only thing permitted them. The time seemed so long to Belle-Etoile, and still no signs of her beloved Cheri, that she fell dangerously ill; and in the hopes of curing her , Petit-Soleil resolved to seek him.",
  "But he too was swallowed up by the rock and fell into the great hall. The first person he saw was Cheri, but he could not speak to him; and Prince Heureux, following soon after, met with the same fate as the other two. When Feintise was aware that the third Prince was gone, she was exceedingly delighted at the success of her plan; and when Belle-Etoile, inconsolable at finding not one of her brothers return, reproached herself for their loss, and resolved to follow them, she was quite overjoyed.",
  "The Princess was disguised as a cavalier , but had no other armour than her helmet. She was dreadfully cold as she drew near the rock, but seeing a turtle-dove lying on the snow , she took it up, warmed it, and restored it to life: and the dove reviving, gaily said, \"I know you, in spite of your disguise; follow my advice: when you arrive at the rock, remain at the bottom and begin to sing the sweetest song you know; the green bird will listen to you; you must then preten d to go to sleep; when it sees me, it will come down to peck me, and at that moment you will be able to seize it.\"",
  "All this fell out as the Dove foretold. The green bird begged for liberty . \"First,\" said Belle-Etoile, \"I wish that thou wouldst restore my three brothers to me.\" \"Under my left wing there is a red feather ,\" said the bird: \"pull it out, and touch the rock with it.\"",
  "The Princess hastened to do as she was instructed; the rock split from the top to the bottom: she entered with a victorious air the hall in which stood the three Princes with many others; she ran towards Cheri, who did not know her in her helmet and male attire, and could neithe r speak nor move.",
  "The green bird then told the Princess she must rub the eyes and mouth of all those she wished to disenchant with the red feather , which good of fice she did to all. The three Princes and Belle-Etoile hastened to present themselves to the King; and when Belle-Etoile showed her treasures, the little green bird told him that the Princes Petit-Soleil and Heureux and the Princess Belle-Etoile were his children, and that Prince Cheri was his nephew .",
  "Queen Blondine, who had mourned for them all these years, embraced them, and the wicked Queen-Mother and old Feintise were justly punished. And the King, who thought his nephew Cheri the handsomest man at Court, consented to his marriage with Belle-Etoile. And lastly , to make everyone happy , the King sent for the Corsair and his wife, who gladly came.",
  "ALADDIN was the son of a poor tailor in an Eastern city. He was a spoiled boy, and loved play better than work; so that when Mustapha, his father , died, he was not able to earn his living; and his poor mother had to spin cotton all day long to procure food for their support.",
  "But she dearly loved her son, knowing that he had a good heart, and she believed that as he grew older he would do better , and become at last a worthy and prosperous man. One day, when Aladdin was walking outside the town, an old man came up to him, and looking very hard in his face, said he was his father's brother , and had long been away in a distant country , but that now he wished to help his nephew to get on.",
  "He then put a ring on the boy's finger , telling him that no harm could happen to him so long as he wore it. Now , this strange man was no uncle of Aladdin, nor was he related at all to him; but he was a wicked magician, who wanted to make use of the lad's services, as we shall see presently . The old man led Aladdin a good way into the country , until they came to a very lonely spot between two lofty black mountains.",
  "Here he lighted a fire, and threw into it some gum, all the time repeating many strange words. The ground then opened just before them, and a stone trap-door appeared. After lifting this up, the Magician told Aladdin to go below , down some broken steps, and at the foot of these he would find three halls, in the last of which was a door leading to a garden full of beautiful trees; this he was to cross, and after mounting some more steps, he would come to a terrac e, when he would see a niche, in which there was a lighted Lamp.",
  "Aladdin found all the Magician had told him to be true; he passed quickly but cautiously through the three halls, so as not even to touch the walls with his clothes, as the Magician had directed. He took the Lamp from the niche, threw out the oil, and put it in his bosom.",
  "As he came back through the garden, his eyes were dazzled with the bright-coloured fruits on the trees, shining like glass. Many of these he plucked and put in his pockets, and then returned with the Lamp, and called upon his uncle to help him up the broken steps. \"Give me the Lamp,\" said the old man, angrily .",
  "Aladdin told the Genius of the Ring that he only wanted to be set free, and to be taken back to his mother . In an instant he found himself at home, very hungry , and his poor moth er was much pleased to see him again. He told her all that had happened; she then felt curious to look at the Lamp he had brought, and began rubbing it, to make it shine brighter .",
  "Both were quite amaz ed at seeing rise before them a strange figure; this proved to be the Genius of the Lamp, who asked for their commands. On hearing that food was what they most wanted, a black slave instantly entered with the choicest fare upon a dainty dish of silver , and with silver plates for them to eat from. Aladdin and his mother feasted upon the rich fare brought to them, and sold the silver dish and plates, on the produce of which they lived happily for some weeks. Aladdin was now able to dress well, and in taking his usual walk, he one day chanced to see the Sultan's daughter coming with her attendants from the baths. He was so much struck with her beauty , that he fell in love with her at once, and told his mother that she must go to the Sultan, and ask him to give the Princess to be his wife.",
  "The poor woman said he must be crazy; but her son not only knew what a treasure he had got in the Magic Lamp, but he had also found how valuable were the shining fruits he had gathered, which he thought at the time to be only coloured glass. At first he sent a bowlful of these jewels—for so they were—to the Sultan, who was amazed at their richness, and said to Aladdin's mother: \"Your son shall have his wish, if he can send me, in a week, forty bowls like this, carried by twenty white and twenty black slaves, handsomely dressed.\" He thought by this to keep what he had got, and to hear no more of Aladdin. But the Genius of the Lamp soon brought the bowls of jewels and the slaves, and Aladdin's mothe r went with them to the Sultan.",
  "The Sultan was overjoyed at receiving these rich gifts, and at once agreed that the Princess Bulbul should be the wife of Aladdin. The happ y youth then summoned the Genius of the Lamp to assist him; and shortly set out for the Palace. He was dressed in a handsome suit of clothes, and rode a beautiful horse; by his side marched a number of attendants, scattering handfuls of gold among the people.",
  "As soon as they were married, Aladdin ordered the Genius of the Lamp to build, in the course of a night, a most superb Palace, and there the young couple lived quite happily for some time. One day, when Aladdin was out hunting with the Sultan, the wicked Magician, who had heard of his good luck, and wished to get hold of the Magic Lamp, cried out in the streets, \"New lamps for old ones!\" A silly maid in the Palace, hearing this, got leave of the Princess to change Aladdin's old Lamp, which she had seen on a cornice where he always left it, for a new one, and so the Magician got possession of it.",
  "As soon as the Magician had safely got the Lamp, he caused the Genius to remove the Palace, and Bulbul within it, to Africa. Aladdin's grief was very great, and so was the rage of the Sultan at the loss of the Princess, and poor Aladdin's life was in some danger , for the Sultan threatened to kill him if he did not restore his daughter in three days. Aladdin first called upon the Genius of the Ring to help him, but all he could do was to take him to Africa.",
  "The Princess was rejoiced to see him again, but was very sorry to find that she had been the cause of all their trouble by parting with the wonderful Lamp. Aladdin, however , consoled her, and told her that he had thought of a plan for getting it back. He then left her, but soon returned with a powe rful sleeping-draught, and advised her to receive the Magician with pretended kindness, and pour it into his wine at dinner that day, so as to make him fall sound asleep, when they could take the Lamp from him. Everything happened as they expected; the Magician drank the wine, and when Aladdin came in, he found that he had fallen back lifeless on the couch. Aladdin took the Lamp from his bosom, and called upon the Genius to transport the Palace, the Princess, and himself, back to their native city. The Sultan was as much astonis hed and pleased at their return, as he had been provoked at the loss of his daughter; and Aladdin, with his Bulbul, lived long afterwards to enjoy his good fortune.",

  "But the ocean would take out the starch in a trice. And she wanted blue shoes, for she thought them “so sweet,” So she sobbed out afresh for she saw she’d no feet. And she wept, and she wailed, and she sobbed, and she sighed, Till her tears added salt to the salty sea’ s tide.",
  "Who made the camel work all day and gave him ne’er a chance To lay his heavy load aside and do a fancy dance. But when they reached a city and heard street musicians play , The camel danced a step or two while jogging on his way , And quickly people thronged about to wonder and to stare,",
  "When Billy W ilson swimming went, It took him half a day To reach the lake because, you see, It was so far away . And so, to stop this loss of time, When next he went to swim He tied a string around the lake, And pulled it home with him.",

  "XX BEDFELLOWS 107 XXI ONE WAY TO KEEP WARM 112 XXII QUEER MR. PINE FINCH 117 XXIII A FEAST AT LAST 122 THE TALE OF DICKIE DEER MOUSE I A LITTLE GENTLEMAN All the four-footed folk in the neighborhood agreed that Dickie Deer Mouse was well worth knowing. Throughout Pleasant Valley there was no one else so gentle as he.",
  "To be sure, Jasper Jay wore beautiful—perhaps even gaudy—clothes; but his manners were so shocking that nobody would ever call him a gentleman. As for Dickie Deer Mouse, he was always tastefully dressed in fawn color and white. And except sometimes in the spring, when he needed a new coat, he was a real joy to see.",
  "For he both looked and acted like a well-bred little person. It is too bad that there were certain reasons—which will appear later—why some of his feathered neighbors did not like him. But even they had to admit that Dickie was a spick-and-span young chap. Wherever he was white he was white as snow .",
  "And many of the wild people wondered how he could scamper so fast through the woods and always keep his white feet spotless. Possibly it was because his mother had taught him the way when he was young ; for his feet—and the under side of him —were white even when he was just a tiny fellow , so young that the top side of him was gray instead of fawn colored.",
  "How his small white feet would twinkle as he frisked about in the shadows of the woods and ran like a squirrel through the trees! And how his sharp little cries would break the wood-silence as he called to his friends in a brisk chatter , which sounded like that of the squirrels, only ever so far away! In many other ways Dickie Deer Mouse was like Frisky Squirrel himself. Dickie's idea of what a good home ought to be was much the same as Frisky's: they both thought that the deserted nest of one of the big Crow family made as fine a house as any one could want.",
  "And they couldn't imagine that any food could possibly be better than nuts, berries and grain. To be sure, Dickie Deer Mouse liked his nuts to have thin shells. But that was because he was smaller than Frisky; so of course his jaws and teeth were not so strong. Then, too, Dickie Deer Mouse had a trick of gathering good things to eat, which he hid away in some safe place, so that he would not have to go hungry during the winter , when the snow lay deep upon the ground.",
  "It was no wonder that Dickie could be cheerful right in the dead of winter , when he had a fine store of the very best that the fields and forest yielded, to keep him sleek and fat and happy . So even on the coldest nights, when the icy wind whipped the tree-tops, and the cold, pale stars peeped down among the branches, Dickie scampered through the woods with his friends and had the gayest of times.",
  "No one would have thought that he had a care in the world. II HUNTING A HOME Warm weather was at hand. And Dickie Deer Mouse gave up frolicking with his friends for a time, because he needed to find a pleasant place in which to spend the summer .",
  "He had his eye on a nest high in the top of a tall elm, where a certain black rascal known as old Mr. Crow had lived for a long while. Now , Dickie had heard a bit of gossip, to the effect that the old gentleman had moved to another tree nearer to Farmer Green's cornfield.",
  "So Dickie wanted to lose no time. He was afraid that if he waited, some brisk member of the Squirrel family would settle himself in Mr . Crow's old home. Without telling anybody what was in his head, Dickie Deer Mouse set forth one pleasant, warm night in the direction of the great elm, where he hoped to pass a number of delightful months.13 14 15",
  "It was some distance to the tall tree. But the night was fine, and Dickie enjoyed his journey , though once he stopped and shivered when he heard the wailing whistle of a screech owl. \"That's Simon Screecher!\" Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed under his breath. \"I know his voice. And I hope he won't come this way!\"",
  "Dickie halted for a few minutes, near an old oak with spreading roots, under which he intended to hide in case Simon Screecher should suddenly appear . But he soon decided that Simon was headed for another part of the woods, for his quavering cry grew fainter and fainter .",
  "So Dickie promptly for got his fright and scampered on again faster than before, to make up the time he had lost. Though he travelled through the flickering shadows like a brown and white streak, he did not pant the least bit when he reached old Mr. Crow's elm. He did not need to pause at the foot of the tree to get his breath, but scurried up it as if climbing was one of the easiest things he did.",
  "Mr. Crow's big nest was so far from the ground that many people would not have cared to visit it except with the help of an elevator . But Dickie Deer Mouse never stopped to think of such a thing. Of course it would have done him no good, anyway , to wish for an elevator , for there was none in all Pleasant Valley .",
  "In fact, even Johnnie Green himself had only heard of—and never seen—one. It took Dickie Deer Mouse only a few moments to reach the top of the tall elm, where Mr. Crow's bulky nest, built of sticks and lined with grass and moss, rested in a crotch formed by three branches.",
  "Dickie had never before been so close to Mr. Crow's old home. And now he stood still and looked at it with great interest. It was ever so much bigger than he had supposed, and exactly the sort of dwelling—cool and airy—that he had hoped to find for his summer home.",
  "And then he climbed quickly up the side of the nest and whisked down inside it. The next moment a great commotion frightened him nearly out of his wits. A deafening squawking smote Dickie Deer Mouse's big ears. And something struck him a number of blows that knocked his breath quite out of him.",
  "III A STARTLED SLEEPER Of course Dickie Deer Mouse ought not to have been so ready to believe that stray bit of gossip about Mr. Crow . It is true that the old black scamp had talked about moving to a new place nearer Farmer Green's cornfield. But his plan had gone no further than that.",
  "He was sound asleep in his bed when Dickie Deer Mouse jumped down beside him. And when Mr. Crow suddenly waked up it would be very hard to say which of the two was the more startled. For a few moments Mr. Crow screamed loudly for help. And he flapped and floundered about as if he didn't know which way to turn, nor what to do.",
  "During the uproar Dickie Deer Mouse managed to slip out of Mr. Crow's house without being seen. But he was too polite to run away . Instead of hurrying of f to escape a scolding from Mr . Crow he clung to a near -by branch and called as loudly as he could: \"Don't be alarmed, sir!",
  "There's no one here but me. And I ask your pardon for disturbing you.\" Dickie Deer Mouse had to repeat that speech several times before Mr. Crow noticed him. But at last the old gentleman caught sight of his visitor . And when he heard what Dickie said he looked far from pleasant.",
  "Crow spluttered. \"And receiving it is another .\" \"I'm very sorry ,\" Dickie Deer Mouse replied. \"I didn't mean to frighten you.\" Mr. Crow gave a sudden hoarse haw-haw . \"Pooh!\" he cried. \"Y ou don't think I was scared, do you?\" \"You called for help,\" Dickie reminded him. \"Certainly I did,\" Mr. Crow agreed.",
  "That explanation gave Dickie Deer Mouse another surprise; for he had suppose d all the time that Mr. Crow didn't know who—or what—had awakened him. \"Oh!\" he cried. \"I thought that you thought I was somebody else.\" Mr. Crow glared at him. \"I thought that you thought that I thoug ht——\" he squalled.",
  "He was so angry that his tongue became sadly twisted; and he all but choked. Meanwhile Dickie Deer Mouse waited respectfully until Mr . Crow had recovered his speech. \"What are you doing here at this hour?\" Mr . Crow demanded at last. \"I thought——\" Dickie began. \"There you go again!\"",
  "I asked you what you were doing .\" \"I'm not doing anything just now ,\" Dickie Deer Mouse faltered. \"Yes, you are!\" Mr . Crow corrected him. \"Y ou're sitting on a limb of my tree.... Get of f it at once!\" So Dickie Deer Mouse moved to a more distant perch.",
  "Mr. Crow exploded. \"Get out of my tree this instant!\" It always made him ill-tempered to be awakened from a sound sleep in the middle of the night. Once more Dickie Deer Mouse asked his pardon. \"I was told,\" he explained, \"that you had moved lately . And I did not expect to find you here.",
  "Crow . \"I know now why you came sneaking into my house. You'd like to live here yourself.\" \"Pardon me!\" Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed with the lowest of bows. \"You are mistaken, Mr. Crow . Though your house is a fine, lar ge one, it's much too small to hold us both.\"",
  "And whisking about, while Mr . Crow stared at him, he ran down the tall elm as fast as he could go. It was clear that if Mr . Crow wasn't going to move he would have to look elsewhere for a summer home. IV THE BLACKBIRD'S NEST For a few days after his visit to Mr. Crow's elm, Dickie Deer Mouse kept watch carefully of Mr. Crow's comings and goings.",
  "And he decided at last that the old gentleman liked his home too well to leave it. But Dickie was not discouraged. He had no doubt that he could find some other pleasant quarters in which to spend the summer—quarters that would prove almost as airy , and perhaps more convenient—because they were not so high.",
  "For there was no denying that Mr . Crow's nest was a long, long way from the ground. So Dickie began to search for birds' nests. And for a time he had to suffer a great deal of scolding by his feathered neighbors. It must be confessed that they were none too fond of Dickie Deer Mouse.",
  "That seems a strange deed on the part of anyone so gentle as Dickie Deer Mouse. But old Mr. Crow always declared that it was true. And Solomon Owl often remarked that he wished Dickie Deer Mouse would try to drive him away from his home in the hollow hemlock.",
  "Dickie scampered through the woods with his friends But during his hunt for birds' nests Dickie Deer Mouse was careful to keep away from Solomon Owl, and his cousin Simon Screecher , and all the rest of the Owl family . He contented himself with hasty peeps into nests built by such smaller folk as Blackbirds and Robins. And if it happened that anybody was living in one of those nests, Dickie soon found it out.",
  "For the angry owners were sure to fly at him with screams of rage, and peck at his head as they darted past him. It was really not worth while getting into a fight over a bird's nest, when there was plenty of old ones in which nobody dwelt. To be sure, many of them were almost ready to fall apart.",
  "But Dickie Deer Mouse finally found one to his liking— a last year's bird's nest where two Black birds had reared a promising family . They had not come back to Pleasant Valley . And there was their house, almost as good as new , just waiting for some one to move in and make himself at home.",
  "Nobody objected when Dickie took the old nest for his home, though many a bird in the neighborhood remarked in his hearing that he would hate to be too lazy to build a house for himself. Dickie Deer Mouse was too mild and gentle-mannered to make any reply to such rude speeches.",
  "Besides, he expected to make a good many changes in the old nest before the place was exactly what he wanted. \"I don't understand,\" he said aloud to nobody in particular , \"why most birds don't know how a house should be built. Of all the birds in Pleasant Valley the only good nest-builder I know is Long Bill Wren.",
  "He must be a very sensible fellow , because he puts a roof on his house.\" Now , Dickie Deer Mouse may—or may not—have known that some of his bird neighbors were near at hand, watching him. Certainly they must have heard what he said, for they began to scold at the top of their voices.",
  "V DICKIE'S SUMMER HOME Dickie Deer Mouse was busier than ever. When he wasn't looking for food—and eating it when he had found it—he gathered cat-tail down in Cedar Swamp. If there was one thing that he liked in a house it was a soft bed. And he knew that if the weather happened to be chilly now and then, he could snuggle into the cat-tail down and sleep as comfortably as he pleased.",
  "The swamp was none too near his new home; and he might have found moss or shreds of bark near-by that would have served his purpose. But he would rather have cat-tail down, even though he had to make a good many trips back and forth before he finally lined the old bird's nest to his liking.",
  "Then, having finished his bed, he had to make a roof over it. So he covered the top of his house with moss, leaving a hole right under the eaves, for a doorway . When Dickie's home was done he was so pleased with it that he asked all his neighbors if they didn't like his \"improvements,\" as he called the additions he had made.",
  "And all his Deer Mouse relations told him that he certainly had a fine place. But none of the birds cared for it at all, except Long Bill Wren; and even he remarked that the house would be better \"if it was rounder .\" As for Jasper Jay , he told Dickie Deer Mouse that, in his opinion, the house was ruined.",
  "His views, however , did not trouble Dickie Deer Mouse in the least. The place suited him. And he was so happy in it that sometimes when the weather was bad and he wasn't whisking about in the trees, or scurrying around on the ground, he would stay inside his cozy home, with only his head sticking out through the doorway , while his big, bright, bulging, black eyes took in everything that happened in his dooryard.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse knew that one needed sharp eyes to spy him when he was peeping from his house in that fashion. And often when somebody of whom he was really afraid came wandering through the woods, Dickie would keep quite still, while he watched the newcomer without being seen.30 31 32 33",
  "But with some of the wood folk he took no chances. Whenever he heard Solomon Owl's rolling call, or his cousin Simon Screecher's quavering whistle, Dickie Deer Mouse always pulled his head inside his house in a hurry . For they were usually on the lookout for him. And he knew it.",
  "Of course, if they had been aware that Dickie Deer Mouse was hidden inside his rebuilt, last year's bird's nest, either of them, with his sharp claws, could easily have torn the moss roof off Dickie's home. But luckily for Dickie, there were some things that they didn't know .",
  "VI A WARNING If old Mr. Crow had minded his own affairs everything would have gone well with Dickie Deer Mouse, after he moved into his new home. But Mr. Crow could not forget the time when Dickie had awakened him out of a sound sleep and frightened him almost out of his mind. So whenever he caught sight of Dickie the old gentleman was sure to drop down upon the ground and ask him in a loud voice whose house he had prowled into lately .",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse always told him. And then he would assure Mr. Crow that he was very sorry to have disturbed his rest. It was quite like Mr . Crow , on such occasions, to act grumpy . \"I haven't had a good night's sleep since you broke into my house,\" he declared to Dickie one day . \"Perhaps you're over -eating,\" Dickie suggested politely .",
  "Old Mr . Crow did not appear to like that remark. \"Nothing of the sort!\" he bawled. \"I don't eat enough to keep a mosquito alive.\" \"I often see you in the cornfield,\" Dickie Deer Mouse told him. \"Ha!\" Mr . Crow exclaimed. \"What are you doing in the cornfield, I should like to know?\" \"Sometimes I go there to get a few kernels of corn,\" Dickie explained.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse couldn't help being worried when Mr . Crow said that. And he looked puzzled, too. \"I don't see,\" he said, \"how I could have got you into a peck of trouble, Mr. Crow , for I haven't eaten a peck of Farmer Green's corn. I've had only a few kernels of it—not more than half a pint.\"",
  "You'll have to keep away from my—ahem!—from Farmer Green's cornfield. And what's more, Fatty Coon says the same thing.\" At the mention of Fatty Coon's name Dickie Deer Mouse had to smile. \"Fatty Coon!\" he echoed. \"How he does like corn!\" \"Yes! But he doesn't like you,\" Mr. Crow snapped.",
  "Mr . Crow inquired. But Dickie Deer Mouse made no answer . Right before Mr. Crow's sharp eyes he vanished among the roots of a tree. And it made the old gentleman quite peevish because he couldn't discover where Dickie Deer Mouse had hidden himself. For a little while Mr. Crow stood like a black statue and peered at the tangle where Dickie Deer Mouse had disappeared.",
  "But Mr . Crow couldn't see him anywhere. And at last his patience came to an end. \"He never answered my question,\" Mr. Crow grumbled. \"He wouldn't tell me where he lived. But I'll find out. I'll ask my cousin, Jasper Jay; for there isn't much that he doesn't know .\"",
  "Of course Jasper Jay knew where Dickie Deer Mouse lived. And he took great pleasure in pointing out the exact spot to his curious cousin, old Mr . Crow . It was broad daylight when they visited the tree where Dickie's house hung. The two rogues did not know that he was drowsing inside his snug home, because he had been out late the night before.",
  "No one that knew the two cousins would need to be told that they could neve r talk together quietly . Perched close to Dickie's house, Mr . Crow croaked in a hoarse voice, while Jasper Jay squalled harshly . \"This is it!\" Jasper had announced, as soon as they arrived.",
  "And isn't it a sight?\" \"I should say so!\" old Mr . Crow agreed. \"It's got a roof on it—ha! ha!\" And the two visitors laughed loudly , as if they thought there was a huge joke somewhere. They made such a noise, from the very first, that Dickie Deer Mouse awoke and heard almost everything they said.",
  "But he didn't mind their remarks in the least—until he caught Fatty Coon's name. It was old Mr . Crow who mentioned it first. \"I'll have to tell Fatty Coon about this queer house,\" he chuckled. \"It's too good a joke to keep. He'll be over here as soon as he knows where to come, for he'll be glad to see it; and he wants to talk to Dickie Deer Mouse about taking our corn.\"",
  "Dickie had still felt somewhat sleepy during the first part of this talk outside his house. But when Mr. Crow began to speak about Fatty Coon, Dickie became instantly wide awake. He sprang quickly to his feet; and thrusting his head through his doorway , he called in his loudest tone: \"When do you think Fatty Coon will call on me?\"",
  "The two cousins looked at each other . And then they looked all around. \"What was that strange squeaking?\" Mr . Crow asked Jasper Jay . \"To me it sounded a good deal like a rusty hinge on Farmer Green's barn door ,\" Jasper Jay answered. But Mr . Crow shook his head.",
  "Still Mr . Crow couldn't agree with him. \"Don't be silly!\" he snapped. \"W e're half a mile from the farmhouse.\" \"Well, what do you think the noise was?\" Jasper Jay inquired. Old Mr. Crow cocked an eye upward into the tree-top above him. \"I'd think it was a Squirrel if it was louder ,\" he replied.",
  "Jasper Jay laughed in a most disagreeable fashion. \"I'd think it was thunder if it was loud enough,\" he sneered. And at that the two cousins began to quarrel violently . To tell the truth, they never could be together long without having a dispute. For a short time Dickie Deer Mouse listened to their rude remarks, hoping that they would stop wrangling long enough to hear his question about Fatty Coon.",
  "But they talked louder and louder . And since Dickie Deer Mouse never quarreled with anybody , and hated to hear such language as the two cousins used, he slipped out of his house without their seeing him and went over to the cornfield. For he was hungry .40 41 42 43",
  "VIII IN THE CORNFIELD In one way, especially , Fatty Coon and Dickie Deer Mouse were alike: They were night-prowlers. When they slept it was usually broad daylight outside, and the birds—except for a few odd fellows like Willie Whip-poor -will and Mr. Night Hawk—were abroad, and singing, and twittering. And when most of the birds went to sleep Dickie and Fatty Coon began to feel quite wide awake. It was not strange, therefore, that Dickie Deer Mouse was surprised when he found himself face to face with Fatty Coon in the cornfield at midday . Dickie tried to slip out of sight under a pumpkin vine that grew between the rows; but Fatty Coon saw him before he could hide.",
  "And Fatty began to make the queerest noise, as if he were almost choking. Dickie Deer Mouse stopped. And he trembled the least bit; for Fatty looked terribly fierce. Perhaps (Dickie thought) he was choking with rage. \"Can I help you?\" Dickie asked him. \"W ould you like me to thump you on the back?\"",
  "Fatty Coon shook his head. There was nothing the matter with him, except that he had stuffed his mouth so full that he couldn't speak. After swallowing several times he wiped his mouth on the back of his paw—a habit of which his mother had never been able to break him.",
  "It was no wonder that dainty Dickie Deer Mouse shuddered again, when Fatty did that. \"May I go and get you a napkin?\" Dickie asked, as he edged away . \"No!\" Fatty Coon growled. \"I've been wanting to have a talk with you. And now that I've found you, you needn't run of f.\" Then, to Dickie's horror , Fatty stopped talking and licked both his paws.",
  "And he looked much interested, and seemed quite downcast when Dickie said \"No!\" \"Then you needn't trouble yourself,\" Fatty Coon told him with a sigh. \"Can't you find corn enough for a good meal?\" Dickie asked him wonderingly . \"I could,\" said Fatty Coon, \"if other people didn't take so much of it....",
  "Now , there's Mr. Crow ,\" he complained. \"I had to get out of bed and come over here to-day , in the sunlight, because I was afraid he wouldn't leave any corn for me. \"There's no use saying anything to him,\" Fatty continued, \"because he thinks this is his cornfield....",
  "But little chaps like you will have to keep away from this place.... Now I've warned you,\" he added. \"And if I hear of your eating any more corn I'll come straight to your house—when I find out where it is—and I'll——\" He did not finish his threat. But he looked so darkly at Dickie that what he didn't say made Dickie Deer Mouse shiver all over, though the warm midday sun fell upon the cornfield. Now , Dickie Deer Mouse hadn't eaten a single kernel of corn all that day.",
  "But he suddenly lost his appetite for it; and murmuring a faint good-bye he turned and ran for the woods as fast as he could go. \"Stop! Stop!\" Fatty Coon called after him. \"There's something more I want to say to you.\" But whatever it may have been, Dickie Deer Mouse did not wait to hear it.",
  "IX FATTY COON NEEDS HELP The moment he plunged into the woods beyond the cornfield Dickie Deer Mouse began to feel better . He knew that Fatty Coon would not leave that place of plenty until he had filled himself almost to bursting with tender young corn. After Dickie had eaten a few seeds that he found under the trees, as well as a plump bug that was hiding beneath a log, he actually told himself that he was glad he had met Fatty Coon in the cornfield.",
  "That thought was a great comfort to him. Ever since he had waked up and heard Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay talking outside his house he had felt most uneasy . If Mr. Crow was going to guide Fatty Coon to his new home, Dickie hardly thought it safe to stay there any longer .",
  "But now he was sure that that danger was past. Fatty had given him his warning. And Dickie had no doubt that so long as he kept away from the corn his greedy neighbor would never bother to disturb him. So instead of quitting his snug home—as he had feared he must—he went back to it to finish his nap.",
  "Now , Dickie Deer Mouse had lost so much sleep—through being disturbed by Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay—that when night came he kept right on sleeping. Yes! Instead of joining his friends in a mad scamper through the woods in the moonlight, Dickie Deer Mouse slept on and on and on, until—something shook the small tree where he lived and made it sway as if an earthquake had come. Dickie Deer Mouse roused himself with a start.",
  "His sharp ears caught a scratching sound. And sticking his head through his doorway , he looked out. One quick glance told him what was happening. That pudgy rascal, Fatty Coon, was climbing the tree! And every moment brought him nearer and nearer to Dickie's house. Dickie's big, black eyes bulged more than ever as he whisked out of his house and scampered to the top of the tree, where the branches were so small that Fatty Coon could never follow him.",
  "Fatty Coon cried. \"Mr . Crow told me where I could find you. And I want to have a word with you.\" \"What sort of word?\" Dickie Deer Mouse inquired. \"It's about the cornfield,\" Fatty Coon explained. \"I haven't been near that place since you last saw me there,\" Dickie declared.",
  "I'm in a peck of trouble. And I want you to help me.\" Dickie Deer Mouse could scarcely believe it. But being a very polite young gentleman, he told Fatty that he would be glad to do anything in his power to assist him—or at least, anything except to come down out of the top of the tree.",
  "X A BIT OF ADVICE \"It's like this,\" Fatty Coon said, puffing a bit—on account of his climb—as he looke d up at Dickie Deer Mouse. \"Old Mr. Crow says that Farmer Green is going to sick old dog Spot on me if I don't keep out of the cornfield.",
  "Crow to tell you,\" Dickie remarked. Fatty Coon was not so sure of that. \"He'd like to have the cornfield to himself,\" he told Dickie. \"He'd like nothing better than to keep me out of it. And if old dog Spot is coming there after me, I certainly don't want to go near the place again.\"",
  "That's just the trouble!\" Fatty Coon cried. \"I can't! I'm too fond of corn. And that's why I've come here to have a word with you,\" he went on. \"I've noticed that you haven't set foot in the cornfi eld since I spoke to you over there in the middle of the day .",
  "And I want you to tell me how you manage to stay away .\" \"Something seems to pull me right away from it,\" Dickie Deer Mouse told him. Fatty Coon groaned. \"Something seems to pull me towar ds the corn!\" he wailed. Dickie Deer Mouse couldn't help feeling sorry for him.",
  "Fatty Coon exclaimed. \"Have you ever tried horns ?\" Dickie Deer Mouse asked him. Fatty Coon looked puzzled. \"What kind?\" he asked his small friend. \"Deer's!\" Dickie explained. \"You know they drop them in the woods sometime s. I've had many a meal off deer's horns. And I can say truthfully that there's nothing quite like them when you're hungry .\"",
  "Fatty Coon actually began to look hopeful. \"I'm always hungry ,\" he announced. \"And perhaps if I could get a taste of deer's horns they would keep my mind off the cornfield. Where did you say I could find some?\" \"I didn't say,\" Dickie Deer Mouse reminded him; \"but I don't object to telling you where to look.",
  "They're generally to be found in the woods, near the foot of a tree.\" Fatty Coon's face brightened at once. \"Then it ought to be easy for me to get a taste of some,\" he cried. And he began to crawl down the tree even as he spoke. He did not thank Dickie Deer Mouse for his help.",
  "But that was like Fatty . Always having his mind on eatables, he was more than likely to for get to be polite. Little Dickie Deer Mouse smiled as he watched the actions of his late caller . The instant Fatty Coon reached the ground he began to look under the trees—first one and then another .",
  "XI A SEARCH IN VAIN It was true that Dickie Deer Mouse and all his relations feasted on the horns shed by the deer. But of course they didn't find horns in the woods every day. Only at a certain season of the year did the deer drop them. And since that time was now past, and the Deer Mouse family had scoured the woods until they found—and devoured—them all, it is clear that Fatty Coon had started out on a fruitless hunt. But he didn't know that, even if Dickie Deer Mouse did. And that was the reaso n why Dickie smiled as he watched Fatty Coon dodging about among the trees, looking for deer's horns where there couldn't possibly be any . \"It's the finest thing that could happen to Fatty ,\" Dickie Deer Mouse thought.",
  "And so long as he stays away from the cornfield, old dog Spot can't catch him there.\" And then Dickie set forth to find his friends and enjoy a romp in the moonlight. Dawn found him creeping into his house once more. And after what had happened during the night it was not strange that he should dream about Fatty Coon.",
  "It was not a pleasant dream. For some reason or other Fatty Coon seemed to be angry with him, and was shouting in a terrible, deep voice, \"Where's Dickie Deer Mouse? Where's Dickie Deer Mouse?\" And then Dickie awoke, all a-shiver . But of course he felt better at once, for he knew that it was only a dream.",
  "And he stretched himself, and buried his head in his bed of cat-tail down, because the daylight was trickling in through his doorway . \"Wher e's Dickie Deer Mouse ?\" Again that question startled him, though he was wide awake, and couldn't be dreaming. The next instant Dickie's tree began to quiver .",
  "Looking down, he could see that Fatty Coon was in something quite like a rage. \"What's the matter?\" Dickie called to him. Fatty could do nothing but glare and growl at him. \"Have you had your breakfast?\" Dickie asked him. Fatty shook his head. \"No!\" he roared. \"I haven't had a morsel to eat since I last saw you.",
  "I've been hunting for horns all this time. And I've come back to tell you that I don't like your advice. If I followed it much longer there's no doubt that I'd starve to death.\" \"It has kept you out of the cornfield, hasn't it?\" Dickie inquired. \"Yes!\" Fatty admitted.",
  "I'm on my way to the cornfield now.\" He looked at Dickie and frowned, as if to say , \"Just try to stop me!\" \"Aren't you afraid to go there?\" Dickie asked him. Fatty Coon snif fed. \"That story about old dog Spot was nothing but a trick,\" he declared.",
  "He wants all the corn himself.\" \"Don't you think, then, that you and I ought to eat all the corn we can?\" Dickie inquired. \"I certainly do!\" Fatty Coon replied. \"Let's hurry over now and get some!\" Dickie Deer Mouse was only too glad to accept the invitation. And he waited politely until Fatty had reached the ground, before going down himself.",
  "But Dickie Deer Mouse thanked Mr. Crow and told him that after he had had all the corn he wanted he was going back to the woods. Noticing that the old gentleman seemed peevish about something, Dickie said to him: \"There ought to be enough for all.\" But still Mr .",
  "Crow looked glum. \"There's enough for them that don't care for much else,\" he muttered. \"But we can't feed the whole world on this corn, you know .... How would you like it if I took to eating deer's horns—when they're in season, of course?\" \"You can have all the deer's horns you want,\" Fatty Coon remarked thickly—for already his mouth was full.",
  "And being very polite, Dickie Deer Mouse said the same thing; though of course he waited until he could speak distinctly . XII A LITTLE SURPRISE Simon Screecher lived in the apple orchard, in a hollow tree, where he could sleep during the day safe from attack by mobs of small birds, who had the best of reasons for disliking him.",
  "One thing is certain: Dickie Deer Mouse was not eager to make Simon Screecher's acquaintance. Whenever he heard Simon's call he stopped and listened. If it sounded nearer the next time it reache d his ears, Dickie Deer Mouse promptly hid himself in any good place that was handy .",
  "So matters went along for some time. And Dickie actually began to think that perhaps he didn't need to be so careful, and that maybe Simon Screecher was not so bad as people said. However , he jumped almost out of his skin one night, when he heard a wailing whistle in a tree right over his head.",
  "And when he came down upon all-fours again he couldn't see a single place to hide. So he stood stock still, hardly daring to breathe. To Dickie's dismay , a mocking laugh rang out. And somebody said: \"I see you!\" It was Simon Screecher himself that spoke. Dickie Deer Mouse looked up and spied him, sitting on a low limb.",
  "He was not so big as Dickie had supposed. But it was certainly Simon. Dickie knew him, beyond a doubt, by his ear -tufts, which stuck up from his head like horns. \"What made you jump when I whistled?\" Simon Screecher asked him. \"I don't know ,\" Dickie answered, \"unless it was you.\"",
  "Simon Screecher chuckled. \"You're a bright young chap,\" he observed. \"But that's not surprising, for I notice that you belong to the Deer Mouse family , and everybody's aware that they are one of the brightest families in Pleasant Valley— what ar e left of them .\" These last words made Dickie Deer Mouse more uneasy than ever.",
  "But he made up his mind not to let Simon Screecher know that he was worried. \"I have a great many relations,\" he declared stoutly . \"Ours is a big family .\" \"Yes—but not nearly so big as it was when I first came to this neighborhood to live,\" Simon told him with a sly smile.",
  "He had hardly finished that remark when a loud wha-wha, whoo-ah came from a hemlock not far away . And the next moment Simon's cousin Solomon Owl sailed through the moonlight and alighted near him. Dickie Deer Mouse couldn't help thinkin g that it was a great night for the Owl family .",
  "And he was surprised to notice that Simon Screecher did not act overjoyed at seeing his cousin. \"It's a pleasant night,\" said Solomon Owl in his deep, hollow voice. Simon Screecher replied somewhat sourly that he supposed it was. And he changed his seat, so that he might keep his eyes on both his cousin and Dickie Deer Mouse at the same time.",
  "But Solomon Owl made matters very hard for Simon. Simon had no sooner seated himself comfortably when Solomon Owl moved to a perch behind him. Simon Screecher looked almost crosseyed, as he tried to watch everything that happened. And he looked so fretful that for a moment Dickie Deer Mouse actually for got his fear and laughed aloud.",
  "XIII THE FEATHERS FLY \"I'm glad to see you,\" Solomon Owl told his cousin Simon Screecher , while Dickie Deer Mouse stood stock still on the ground beneath the tree where the two cousins were sitting. \"I'm glad to see you. And I hope you're enjoying good health.\" \"I'm well enough,\" Simon Screecher grunted.",
  "Solomon asked him. Simon Screecher admitted that he was not starving. \"Ah!\" Solomon exclaimed. \"Then you can have no objection to sharing a specially nice tidbit with your own cousin.\" Dickie Deer Mouse shivered. But he did not dare move, with one of Simon Screecher's great, glassy eyes staring straight at him.",
  "And there was something else that did not help to put him at his ease: Solomon Owl seemed to be watching him likewise! \"Haven't you dined to-night?\" Simon Screecher inquired in a testy tone. \"Yes!\" Solomon admitted. \"But I haven' t had my dessert yet.... What are you looking at so closely , Cousin Simon, down there on the ground?\"",
  "An angry light came into Simon Screecher's eyes. \"Can't I look where I please?\" he snapped. And he changed his seat again, so that he might get a better view of Dickie and Solomon at the same time. Solomon Owl promptly moved to another limb behind Simon, and slightly higher .",
  "And Dickie Deer Mouse took heart when Simon Screecher began to make a queer sound by opening his beak and shutting it with a snap, as if he would like to nip somebody . Dickie knew that Simon Screecher was in a terrible rage. And unless his threatening actions scared Solomon Owl away , Dickie thought there was likely to be a cousinly fight. He was pleased to notice that Solomon Owl showed no sign of dismay .",
  "There was really no reason why he should. He was much bigger than his peppery cousin. And he looked at Simon in a calm and unruf fled fashion that seemed to make that quarrelsome fellow angrier than ever . \"What's the matter?\" Solomon Owl asked Simon Screecher . \"If you had any teeth I'd think they were chattering....",
  "Are you having a chill?\" Simon made no answer . \"Maybe you're afraid of something,\" Solomon Owl suggested. \"Can it be that young Deer Mouse down there on the ground?\" And he laughed loudly at what he thought was a joke. \"That's my Deer Mouse!\" Simon Screecher squalled, suddenly finding his voice.",
  "So you'd better fly home to your old apple tree in the orchard.\" \"I'll do nothing of the sort!\" Simon Screecher declared; and his voice rose to a shrill quaver . Turning swiftly , he flew straight at his cousin. And then how the feathers did fly! Dickie Deer Mouse wanted to stay right there, for he hated to miss any of the fun.",
  "But he remembered that he was a \"tidbit\"; so he scampered away through the woods. And though he never knew how the fight ended, he was sure of one thing: There was no prize for the winner . XIV MAKING READY FOR WINTER After his escape from Solomon Owl and Simo n Screecher , Dickie Deer Mouse never felt quite so care-free as he always had before, when wandering through the woods at night.",
  "And he never stayed inside his house after dark without wondering whether Solomon or Simon could by any chance discover his snug home in the last year's bird's nest. It was not a pleasant thought. And the oftener it popped into Dickie's head the less he liked it. Sometimes, when summer had ended and fall brought a night that was rainy and cold, he liked to go home after he had finished his supper , and burrow deep into his soft bed of cat-tail down.",
  "But even after he had dried his wet coat and warmed himself well, at such times Dickie Deer Mouse started whenever he heard the slightest noise. Somehow , he couldn't get the Owl family out of his mind. As the days grew shorter—and the nights longer—he began to find that his summer home was not so cozy as it might have been.",
  "The cold wind searched him out, even under his soft covering; and the driving rains trickled annoyingly through his roof of moss. So at last Dickie Deer Mouse made up his mind that he would move once more. And since he was not the sort to put off the doing of anything that had to be done, he set out at once to see what kind of place he could find.",
  "Now , Dickie Deer Mouse liked the woods in which he had always lived. So one might think it strange that when he set forth on his search he headed straight for Farmer Green's pasture. But there is no doubt that he knew what he was about.74 75 76 77",
  "For some time he crept cautiously about the pasture, peeping under big rocks, and moving among the roots of the trees which dotted the hillside here and there. And since his eyes were of the sharpest, what he was looking for he found in surprising numbers. Most people, strolling through the pastu re, would have noticed little except grass and bushes, trees and rocks and knolls.",
  "But those were not the things that Dickie Deer Mouse discovered, and sniffed at. What he was hunting for was holes . For Dickie had decided that when winter came, with its ice and snow , its cruel gales and its piercing cold, he would be far more comfortable under ground than he could ever hope to be in a last year's bird's nest that was fastened to a tree.",
  "He had found it no easy matter to pick out a summer home. And now there were reasons why his search for a winter one was even harder . It is true that at the beginning of summer , when Dickie Deer Mouse climbed the tall elm where Mr. Crow lived, he found the old gentleman asleep in the nest that he had hoped to take for his own.",
  "But on the whole it was easy to discover whether a nest was deserted. One look into it usually told the story . Eggs in a bird's nest meant that somebody must live there. And of course if Dickie saw a bird sitting on a nest he knew right away that he couldn't live there without having a fight first.",
  "There was one hole, especially , among those he found in Farmer Green's pasture, from which Dickie Deer Mouse ran as fast as he could scamper . This was a hole with a big front door, and plenty of fresh dirt scattered around it, as if somebody had been digging there not long before.",
  "When Dickie first noticed the burrow he stopped short and stood quite still, while he peeped at it out of a tangle of blackberry bushes. Something told him that he had stumbled upon the home of a dangerous person. And if the wind hadn't been blowing in his face, as he looked towards the wide opening, he would not have dared stay there as long as he did.",
  "As he looked he suddenly saw a pair of eyes gleaming from the dark cavern. And soon he beheld a long, pointed snout, which its owner thrust outside in a gingerly manner . That was enough for Dickie Deer Mouse. He wheeled about and whisked up the nearest tree he could find.",
  "And there he stayed for a long, long time, until he felt sure that it was quite safe for him to venture down upon the ground again. He had come upon Tommy Fox's burrow! And if there was one hole in the ground into which he had no wish to go, that was it.",
  "For Tommy Fox was no friend of his. Since he didn't care for Tommy's company , Dickie went to the corner of the pasture that was furthest from Tommy's home, to search once more for such a hole as he hoped to find. Almost nobody else ever would have discovered the one that Dickie picked out at last as the best place of all in which to spend the winter .",
  "But the bright eyes of Dickie Deer Mouse found a tiny opening, which he carefully made just big enough to admit him. It was the entrance to an old burrow where an aunt and an uncle of Billy Woodchuck had once lived and raised a numerous family . When the children had all grown up and gone away their parents had left that home for a new one in the clover field.",
  "And somehow all the smaller field people had overlooked it. Little by little the frost had heaved the earth about the doorway , and the wash of the rains had helped to fill it, and Farmer Green's cows had trampled over it, and the grass had all but covered the small opening that remained.",
  "There were signs in plenty about the spot that told Dickie Deer Mouse the burrow was deserted. Or perhaps it would be better to say that there was no sign at all of any occupant. Dickie found not a trace of a path nor even a foot-print near the hole nor did his nose discover the faintest scent either of friend or enemy . Slipping inside the hole, Dickie found himself in the mouth of a big, airy tunnel, which went sharply downwards for a few feet.",
  "XVI A LUCKY FIND Though Dickie Deer Mouse was shy, he couldn't have been a coward. For when he had reached the end of that first pitch that led into the old burrow of Billy Woodchuck's uncle and aunt he never once thought of turning back. Before him stretched a dark, dry , level tunnel.",
  "And through it Dickie quickly made his way . It was surprisingly long—that under ground passage. But he came to the end of it at last. And creeping upwards, because the tunnel rose suddenly , Dickie Deer Mouse found himself in a roomy chamber , comfortably furnished with a big bed of soft, dried grasses, where Mr. and Mrs. Woodchuck had passed a good many hard winters asleep, while the snow lay deep upon the ground above them. It took Dickie Deer Mouse no longer than a jiffy to decide that he had found the very place for which he had been looking.",
  "He knew that in that secret chamber he had nothing to fear from Solomon Owl nor Simon Screecher , nor Fatty Coon, either . And when midwinter came, and the nights turned bitterly cold, he could cuddle down in that soft bed and dream about summer , and warm, moonlit nights in the woods of the world above.",
  "It was no wonder that Dickie Deer Mou se was pleased. And for a time he forgot everything but his good luck—until he remembered that he had had nothing to eat since the night before. So he made his way back through the long tunnel, and up into Farmer Green's pasture.",
  "It certainly would have been a great mishap if he had gone away in such a hurry that he could never have found his doorway again. But it was an easy matter to fix the spot in his mind. When he came back he needed only to follow along the rail fence until he came to the corner .",
  "Not far from the fence corner , in the woods, stood Farmer Green's sugar house. And about the same distance on the other side of the fence a lone straggler of a maple tree stood on a knoll in the pasture. The departed Mr. and Mrs. Woodchuck had been wise enough to dig the opening to their burrow between the roots of the tree. They knew that if Tommy Fox tried to dig them out of their under ground home, he would find the passage between the roots too small to squeeze through.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse smiled as he saw what the builders of his house had done. They had made everything exactly to suit him. He knew that he could have done no better himself; in fact he knew that he couldn't have done nearly so well. For he was no digger .",
  "But he told himself that there was no reason why he should feel sad about that, so long as others were kind enough to dig a fine home and leave it for him to live in. Then he slipped into the woods, feeling so happy that he had to stop and relate his good fortune to the first person he met.",
  "And that was where Dickie Deer Mouse made a slight mistake. XVII A SLIGHT MISTAKE Scarcel y had Dickie Deer Mouse plunged into the woods when he met Fatty Coon coming in the opposite direction. \"Hullo!\" Fatty said, looking up at Dickie, who had scrambled into a tree as soon as he caught sight of Fatty's plump form.",
  "I thought you always stayed in the woods—unless you happened to go to the cornfield.\" \"I've been looking for a winter home,\" Dickie explained. \"And I've just found the finest one you ever saw .\" \"Where is it!\" Fatty asked him. \"I might want to pay you a call some night—when I had nothing else to do.\"",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse was in such a cheerful mood that almost anything Fatty Coon might have said would have pleased him. \"My new house is just beyond the fence,\" Dickie explained. \"But I'm afraid you can't very well visit me there,\" he added with a smile. \"Why not?\" Fatty Coon inquired.",
  "I can climb the tallest tree you ever saw, without feeling dizzy . But of course I'm a bit heavier than you are. And if you've gone and picked out a nest that's a long way above the ground, among the smallest branches, it might not be safe for me to go all the way up to it.\"",
  "Dickie escapes from Tommy Fox \"My new home isn't as high as I am right now ,\" he told Fatty Coon. Fatty grunted. \"Then I'll certainly come to see you,\" he said, \"when time hangs heavily on my hands.\" \"My new house isn't as high as you are right now ,\" Dickie remarked.",
  "And at that Fatty Coon looked puzzled. His mouth fell open; and for a few moments he stared at his small friend without saying a word. \"You must be mistaken,\" he replied at last. \"I'm standing on the ground. And I never saw a last year's bird's nest that was lower than that.\"",
  "Now , you may not believe it, but it has a front hall that's a hundred times as long as your tail.\" Fatty Coon looked around at his ringed tail, with its black tip; and then he looked up at Dickie Deer Mouse again. \"You must be mistaken!\" he cried.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse exclaimed. \"Who's going to stop me?\" Fatty Coon growled. He was used to having his own way. And it always made him angry when anybody tried to upset his plans. \"I'm going to your house in the pasture now; and I'll soon show you that you're mistaken about your front hall....",
  "You come with me and lead the way , young fellow!\" But Dickie Deer Mouse said he was so hungry that he couldn't go back just then. \"I'm headed for the big beech tree to see if I can find a few nuts,\" he announced. At the mention of food Fatty Coon's face took on a dif ferent look.",
  "The front door is under the tree that stands on the knoll just beyond the fence. But you can never get inside it, because you're altogether too fat.\" The stout person on the ground knew that he spoke the truth. And without saying another word he turned about and disappeared in the direction of the farm buildings.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse called to him, just before he was out of sight. \"You might want to measure the corn house.\" But Fatty Coon did not trouble himself to answer . XVIII TOO MANY COUSINS In high spirits Dickie Deer Mouse hurried on through the woods until he came to the big beech tree.",
  "And though many others had been there before him, since the nuts had ripened, Dickie had such a sharp eye for a beech nut that even though it was then night, he soon found enough for a hearty meal. Then he had to have a romp with a few gay fellows whom he met under the beech tree.",
  "And so quickly did the time pass that before he knew it the night had turned gray. Day was breaking. And shouting good-bye to his friends Dickie Deer Mouse ran off towards Farmer Green's pasture. He wanted a nap. And having nothing in his summer home that was worth moving, he knew of no reason why he shouldn't begin at once to live in his new quarters.",
  "He never felt happier than he did as he scampered in and out among the trees, slipped under the rail fence, and streaked across the short grass of the pasture. But when he reached his doorway he stopped in dismay . Where he had expected to see nobody at all, his eyes bulged with surprise at the crowd that had gathered in his dooryard.94 95 96",
  "As soon as he had taken several good looks at the company , Dickie Deer Mouse discovered that they were distant relations of his, of all ages and sizes. And at last he succeeded in sorting them into families. There were three big families. And no one in the whole crowd paid any heed to Dickie Deer Mouse.",
  "They seemed to be talking about something most important, and too busy to notice the newcomer . If the truth were known, the sight of his second and third and fourth cousins did not particularly please Dickie Deer Mouse. But he was an agreeable young gentleman. So he stepped forward and called several of his cousins by name.",
  "And since he couldn't say honestly that he was delighted to see them, he told them how well they looked and said that he hoped they had passed a happy summer . \"Here he is at last!\" everybody cried. \"We've been waiting for you for a long time, because we weren't sure whether we'd found the right place.\"",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse asked them as he looked from one to another in dismay . \"Why , the great house that you've found!\" somebody cried. \"We've heard that it has a front hall a hundred times as long as Fatty Coon's tail. So of course there must be lots of rooms in it; and we've come to keep you company and spend the winter .\"",
  "When he heard that news Dickie Deer Mouse became almost faint. He did not want to hurt his cousins' feelings. But his plan of spending the winter quietly hardly made him welcome the idea of having a dozen half-grown children in his home. \"Who told you about my house?\" he demanded with just a trace of disappointment.",
  "And then Dickie Deer Mouse knew that he had made a mistake when he told Fatty of his good fortune. \"I'm sorry to say that he has misled you,\" Dickie informed his relations. \"It's true that my front hall is very long. But the trouble is, there's only one chamber .\"",
  "XIX THE WRONG TURN For a few moments Dickie Deer Mouse's cousins looked terribly disappointed. He had told them that his new house had only one chamber . And each of the three big families had expected to have at least one bedroom. The elder cousins gathered in a group and talked in low tones.",
  "Dickie could not hear what they said. He hoped that they were going to bid him farewell and go back where they came from. But he soon saw that they had no such idea. The eldest of all, whom Dickie knew as Cousin Dan'l, said to him presently: \"Cheer up!",
  "We know you'd be sorry not to have us with you during the winter . So we'll take a look at your chamber . Perhaps it's big enough for all of us.\" Dickie tried to tell Cousin Dan'l Deer Mouse that he was afraid the chamber would be too crowded with so many in it.",
  "But when he opened his mouth the words, somehow , would not come. And at last he nodded his head and crept through his doorway , while his cousins followed him one by one. The younger cousins pushed and crowd ed and quarreled, making such a commotion that Dickie Deer Mouse could hear them plainly , though he was some distance ahead of them.",
  "Everybody passed the message down the line. And when the youngsters heard it they began to laugh. \"Tell Cousin Dickie to stop us if he can,\" they shouted. Their rude answer reached Dickie Deer Mouse just as he came to a place in his front hall to which he had paid little heed before.",
  "Right at the spot where he stood the tunnel divided itself into two passages. Before, he had taken the one on the right. But now something told him to go the other way. So he turned to the left, still followed closely by the cousin that was behind him. The whole procession came trailing after them.",
  "And the first thing Dickie—or anybody else—knew , they all found themselves standing in the grassy pasture once more, in the gray light of the morning. They had passed out through the back door of the house, without entering the chamber at all! As soon as Dickie's relations saw where they were they looked at one another in a puzzled fashion.",
  "Cousin Dan'l demanded of Dickie. \"I followed the crowd. But I saw no chamber anywhere.\" Dickie Deer Mouse didn't know exactly what to say. So he merely shook his head, hoping that the company would go away . \"Can it be possible that you've lost your bedroom?\" Cousin Dan'l Deer Mouse asked him.",
  "Cousin Dan'l asked Dickie Deer Mouse. \"You see the women are nervous.\" And he cocked an eye up at the sky , as if he did not feel any too safe himself when he thought of Mr . Hawk. \"It seems to me,\" Dickie told him, \"that we'd all of us better go back to our summer homes.\" And then, after saying that he hoped everybody would get home without an accident, and wouldn't meet Mr. Hawk, Dickie Deer Mouse turned towards the woods and hurried away .",
  "His parting words did not make his numerous cousins feel any happier . And since they wanted to get out of sight as soon as they could, they quickly followed Dickie's example and scurried off as fast as they could go, to spend another day in the summer houses in which they had been living.101 102 103 104 105",
  "Now , Dickie Deer Mouse had paused as soon as he had reached the rail fence at the edge of the woods. And unseen by his cousins he peeped back to find out what they might do. When the three families scattered in three dif ferent directions Dickie Deer Mouse believed that he was well rid of them.",
  "But by that time it had grown so light that he did not want to show himself in the pasture, not even long enough to scamper the short distance from the fence back to the front door of his new house. So he passed another day in the last year's bird's nest.",
  "XX BEDFELLOWS During his rambles on the following night Dickie Deer Mouse took great care to keep out of sight of the three families of cousins that had tried to quarter themselves in his new house in the pasture. Moreover he said nothing to anybody about his future home. Fatty Coon had taught him in one lesson that it is sometimes wise to keep a secret.",
  "The night was not ended when Dickie sought the burrow in the pasture once more. He hardly dared hope, as he neared the dooryard, that he would not find a crowd waiting there again. But when he reached his doorway he saw not a soul anywhere around. He felt happy beyond words.",
  "And he popped through his doorway , hurried through the hall—which was a hundred times as long as Fatty Coon's tail—and burst into the cozy chamber . Dickie had hardly entered the room when he stumbled over something soft. And a voice that sounded exactly like Cousin Dan'l's called out in rather a peevish tone that he'd better look out where he stepped.106 107 108",
  "Dickie asked in a faint whisper . \"We are!\" the voice replied. \"There are eighteen of us in all. And you'd better be careful not to trample on anybody .\" Dickie's heart sank. He understood, in a flash, what had happened. The three families of cousins were all there , sleeping in his soft bed of dried grasses!",
  "They had come back to the house in the pasture ahead of him, and had found the chamber without his help. At first he almost turned around and left that place forever , without saying another word. But the night had turned cold and a drizzling rain was falling. And he knew that the roof of his summer home must be leaking badly .",
  "That under ground chamber was delightfully dry and warm. And if the twelve children didn't wake up and begin to cry he saw no reason why he shouldn't spend one night there, anyway . So he felt his way carefully about the room. There was no denying that it was dreadfully crowded.",
  "But at last Dickie Deer Mouse found a vacant spot that was big enough to lie upon. And burrowi ng down into the bed of grasses he soon fell asleep. When Dickie Deer Mouse awoke, after his first sleep in the under ground chamber , he thought that summer had come.",
  "He hadn't felt so comfortable for weeks. And for a little time he lay quite still, half dozing, enjoying the delightful warmth. And then all at once he came to his senses. He remembered that he was in the burrow where Mr. and Mrs. Woodchuck had lived, in Farmer Green's pasture.",
  "And he recalled unpleasantly the misfortune that had happened: he had been forced to share his snug bedroom with eighteen of his distant cousins. They were still sleeping soundly all around him. And Dickie Deer Mouse made a strange wish. \"They're here,\" he said to himself. \"And I don't know of any way to get rid of them.",
  "XXI ONE WAY TO KEEP WARM After making his strange wish about his eighteen cousins—that they would sleep straight through the winter—Dickie Deer Mouse crawled out of bed. The sleepers filled the chamber so full that Dickie had to step into the hall before he could stretch himself. For some reason he seemed to feel unus ually stretchy .",
  "Generally when he waked up he sprang up at once and dashed out of his house, to find something to eat. But now he had half a mind to go back to bed again. He did not do that, however , because he wanted to get away from his unwelcome guests for a time.",
  "So he crept through his long hall and crawled out through his front door , into the world above. To Dickie's great surprise a startling change had come over the pasture. The weather had cleared while he slept and the stars twinkled in the heavens above him. And the hillside pasture was white with a thick blanket of snow .",
  "It was cold, too—much colder than it had been when Dickie went to sleep. Luckily a crust had formed upon the snow—a crust that was just strong enough to support Dickie's weight. And he made swiftly for the spruce woods, to hunt for his supper , for he knew he could find nothing on the ground, covered as it was by the snow .",
  "Dickie felt even hungrier than he usually did when starting out of an evening to look for something to eat. But that was not strange, for without knowing it, he had slept several days and nights in the snug chamber with his cousins. Dickie did not stay out all night long.",
  "Yet he took time, before he went home, to hide a small store of spruce seeds in a hollow rail of the pasture fence. He knew that before the long winter came to an end he would find that food in the woods would grow alarmingly scarce. Long before daybreak Dickie Deer Mouse was glad to return to the under ground chamber .",
  "And as he crept into the crowded room he thought it the coziest home he had ever had. He knew , at last, what made the place so warm. The soft, round bodies of his eighteen cousins heated it almost as well as if he had had a real stove.",
  "It was lucky for him, after all, that Fatty Coon had told them about Dickie's new house. And now Dickie only hoped that none of them would leave before spring. That snowstorm proved to be only the first warning of winter . In a few days the weather grew quite warm again.",
  "And to Dickie's dismay the three families of cousins waked up and went out of doors to get the air, and gather seeds and such thin-shelled nuts as they could find. They did not eat all that they picked up. Like Dickie Deer Mouse, they store d some of the food in secret nooks and crannies, against a time of need.",
  "That first early snowstorm had been a good thing for the dwellers in the under ground chamber . It had warned them that winter was coming. And during the weeks that passed before the whole countryside became snow-bound they managed to gather enough nuts and seeds to last them through any ordinary winter—if they didn't eat too heartily .",
  "When the real winter finally descended upon Pleasant Valley it found the Deer Mouse cousins quite ready for it. And even if Dickie's relations did wake up now and then, when the weather wasn't too cold, they slept soundly enough at other times, so that they did not disturb him greatly .",
  "XXII QUEER MR. PINE FINCH Perhaps the winter was longer than usual; or perhaps Dickie Deer Mouse ate too freely of his hidden store of good things. At any rate, Dickie's hoard slowly grew smaller and smaller . And long before the day came when he bolted the last seed that remained in the hollow fence-rail he had begun to wonder where he should find more food.",
  "While he had been sleeping the birds that stayed in Pleasant Valley during the winter had been feasting greedily upon the very kind of fare that Dickie Deer Mouse needed. Jasper Jay and his noisy cronies had taken good care that there shouldn't be a beechnut left. And when they had eaten the last sweet nut they turned to such dried berries as still clung to the withered stocks on which they had grown.",
  "No longer could Dickie Deer Mouse spend so much time asleep in his cozy chamber . Instead, he had to wander far through the woods at night, thankful to pick up a bit here and there as best he might. On those crisp, cold nights he had to scamper fast in order to keep warm. And often, when dawn came, he crept home still hungry .",
  "At last Dickie's night runs lapped well over into the day. For his search for food became more and more disappointing. And afterward he often wondered what would have happened to him if he hadn't met Mr . Pine Finch early one morning. Mr. Pine Finch was an odd fellow .",
  "He had a peculiar way of talking as if he spoke through his nose. Though Dickie Deer Mouse had seen him before, he had paid scant attention to Mr. Pine Finch. But when he caught sight of him on a certain chilly morning there were so few birds stirring that Dickie stopped short and watched Mr. Pine Finch, who was so busy in a tree-top that he didn't know anybody else was near him.",
  "He was talking to himself. And as nearly as Dickie Deer Mouse could tell, he was remarking—through his nose—that he was having a good breakfast. That news made Dickie Deer Mouse prick up his big ears. A good breakfast was something that he had not enjoyed for a long, long time.",
  "At first Dickie couldn't quite see what Mr. Pine Finch was about. It was he, beyond a doubt. There could be no more mistaking his odd voice than his plump, black-streaked back, with its splashes of yellow at the base of his tail, and his yellow-edged wings. Dickie had a good view of Mr. Pine-Finch's back, because its owner hung upside down from the tips of the branches of the tree where Dickie spied him.",
  "To Dickie Deer Mouse the sight, at first, was somewhat of a puzzle. He stood quite still, gazing upward in wonder . And then all at once he discovered what Mr. Pine Finch was doing. Something struc k Dickie Deer Mouse lightly on his back —something that made him jump.",
  "He looked all around to see what had hit him. And there, on the snow beside him, lay a bud of f the tree above him. Then Dickie Deer Mouse understood what Mr. Pine Finch was about. He was eating the buds that clung to the tips of the branches.",
  "XXIII A FEAST AT LAST To Dickie Deer Mouse, waiting impatiently for Mr. Pine Finch to drop another bud out of the tree-top, it began to seem as if his good luck were short lived. Could it be possible that Mr. Pine Finch was so careful that he lost a bud only once in a long time—perhaps only once a year?",
  "But as Dickie Deer Mouse wondered, a small shower of buds came rattling down upon the snow-crust. And Dickie Deer Mouse snatched them up, every one, and ate them hungrily . In a little while he felt so much better that he called out to Mr . Pine Finch: \"Shake a lot of 'em down—there's a good fellow!\" Mr. Pine Finch fluttered to a perch on a limb and looked down in great surprise.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse piped up. \"You know , I can climb a tree; but I can't crawl out to the tips of the branches, because I'm too heavy . So you'll oblige me if you'll drop a few dozen more of those buds.\" The request surprised Mr . Pine Finch.",
  "Dickie Deer Mouse echoed. \"Why , you've just been eating some yourself!\" And he couldn't help thinking that Mr. Pine Finch was even odder than he sounded. \"That's so,\" Mr. Pine Finch admitted. \"In fact, I may say that I'm very, very fond of tree-buds. But I'm a bird. And of course everybody knows that you're a rodent.\"",
  "He didn't mind Mr. Finch's calling him names, if only he would drop some more buds. \"You're hungry , eh?\" the odd gentleman in the tree replied. \"That reminds me that I'm still hungry myself. So I can't stop to talk with you any longer just now .\" Then he turned himself upside down, as he picked out a promising cluster of buds.",
  "And before he had finished his breakfast he had dropped so many buds that Dickie Deer Mouse called to him and thanked him for his kindness. \"What! Are you still there?\" Mr. Pine Finch exclaimed, gazing down at Dickie as if he were greatly surprised to see him lingering beneath the tree. \"I must go away now,\" Mr. Pine Finch added.",
  "And then he flew of f. Dickie Deer Mouse told himself that he was in luck. By coming to that spot early every day he could pick up buds enough—dropped carelessly by Mr. Pine Finch—to feed himself until spring came and the snow melted and uncovered the ground, where he knew he could find food.",
  "So he went home and slept as he had not slept for weeks. And the next morning, when he went back to the tree where he had found Mr. Pine Finch, his eighteen cousins followed him. For Dickie Deer Mouse told them of his good fortune and asked them to share it with him.",
  "As for Mr. Pine Finch, he looked queerer than ever when he saw that Dickie had brought eighteen of his relations with him. However , he bade them all good morning. And he seemed to be even clum sier than he had been the day before. He dropped an enormous number of buds; so many , in fact, that Dickie Deer Mouse wondered how Mr. Pine Finch managed to get enough breakfast for himself.",
  "Perhaps that odd gentleman knew what he was about. To tell the truth, he had noticed the day before that Dickie Deer Mouse looked thin and hungry . His coat, too, struck Mr. Pine Finch as being somewhat shabby . But he said nothing to show Dickie Deer Mouse that he knew there was anything wrong.",
  "And if he dropped tree-buds on purpose, he never let anyone know it. Anyhow , Mr. Pine Finch did not fail to appear at that tree a single morning during the rest of the winter . Before spring came the Deer Mouse family had long since decided that he was the best friend they had in all Pleasant Valley .",
  "And they all agreed that his voice, although he did talk through his nose, was the pleasantest they had ever heard. At last the breakfast parties beneath Mr. Pine Finch's favorite tree came to an end. The snow vanished. Warm weather made the under ground chamber in Farmer Green's pasture seem crowded and stuffy.",

  "Tඐඍ Vඍඔඞඍගඍඍඖ Rඉඊඊඑග Mඉකඏඍකඡ Wඑඔඔඑඉඕඛ HERE was once a velveteen rabbit, and in the beginning he was really splendid. He was fat and bunchy , as a rabbit should be; his coat was spotted brown and white, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen.",
  "On Christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the Boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the ef fect was charming. There were other things in the stocking, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the Rabbit was quite the best of all. For at least two hours the Boy loved him, and then Aunts and Uncles came to dinner , and there was a great rustling of tissue paper and unwrapping of parcels, and in the excitement of looking at all the new presents the V elveteen Rabbit was forgotten.",
  "Cඐකඑඛගඕඉඛ M඗කඖඑඖඏ For a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor , and no one thought very much about him. He was naturally shy , and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys quite snubbed him. The mechanical toys were very superior , and looked down upon every one else; they were full of modern ideas, and pretended they were real.",
  "The model boat, who had lived through two seasons and lost most of his paint, caught the tone from them and never missed an opportunity of referring to his rigging in technical terms. The Rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed; he thought they were all stuf fed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out-of-date and should never be mentioned in modern circles.",
  "Between them all the poor little Rabbit was made to feel himself very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the Skin Horse. The Skin Horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others. He was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces.",
  "He was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger , and by-and-by break their mainsprings and pass away , and he knew that they were only toys, and would never turn into anything else. For nursery magic is very strange and wonderful, and only those playthings that are old and wise and experienced like the Skin Horse understand all about it.",
  "When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALL Y loves you, then you become Real.\" \"Does it hurt?\" asked the Rabbit. \"Sometimes,\" said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. \"When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.\" \"Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,\" he asked, \"or bit by bit?\"",
  "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily , or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally , by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved of f, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby .",
  "But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly , except to people who don't understand.\" \"I suppose you are real?\" said the Rabbit. And then he wished he had not said it, for he thought the Skin Horse might be sensitive. But the Skin Horse only smiled.",
  "Tඐඍ Sඓඑඖ H඗කඛඍ Tඍඔඔඛ Hඑඛ Sග඗කඡ \"The Boy's Uncle made me Real,\" he said. \"That was a great many years ago; but once you are Real you can't become unreal again. It lasts for always.\" The Rabbit sighed. He thought it would be a long time before this magic called Real happened to him.",
  "He longed to become Real, to know what it felt like; and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad. He wished that he could become it without these uncomfortable things happening to him. There was a person called Nana who ruled the nursery .",
  "The Rabbit didn't mind it so much, for wherever he was thrown he came down soft. One evening, when the Boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him. Nana was in a hurry , and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs at bedtime, so she simply looked about her , and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop.",
  "He'll do to sleep with you!\" And she dragged the Rabbit out by one ear , and put him into the Boy's arms. That night, and for many nights after , the V elveteen Rabbit slept in the Boy's bed. At first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the Boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the Rabbit could scarcely breathe.",
  "And he missed, too, those long moonlight hours in the nursery , when all the house was silent, and his talks with the Skin Horse. But very soon he grew to like it, for the Boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes that he said were like the burrows the real rabbits lived in.",
  "And they had splendid games together , in whispers, when Nana had gone away to her supper and left the night-light burning on the mantelpiece. And when the Boy dropped of f to sleep, the Rabbit would snuggle down close under his little warm chin and dream, with the Boy's hands clasped close round him all night long. And so time went on, and the little Rabbit was very happy–so happy that he never noticed how his beautiful velveteen fur was getting shabbier and shabbier , and his tail becoming unsewn, and all the pink rubbed of f his nose where the Boy had kissed him. Spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the Boy went the Rabbit went too.",
  "He had rides in the wheelbarrow , and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border . And once, when the Boy was called away suddenly to go out to tea, the Rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk, and Nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the Boy couldn't go to sleep unless he was there.",
  "S඘කඑඖඏ Tඑඕඍ \"You must have your old Bunny!\" she said. \"Fancy all that fuss for a toy!\" The Boy sat up in bed and stretched out his hands. \"Give me my Bunny!\" he said. \"Y ou mustn't say that. He isn't a toy . He's REAL!\" When the little Rabbit heard that he was happy , for he knew that what the Skin Horse had said was true at last.",
  "The nursery magic had happened to him, and he was a toy no longer . He was Real. The Boy himself had said it. That night he was almost too happy to sleep, and so much love stirred in his little sawdust heart that it almost burst. And into his boot-button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a",
  "That was a wonderful Summer! Near the house where they lived there was a wood, and in the long June evenings the Boy liked to go there after tea to play . He took the V elveteen Rabbit with him, and before he wandered of f to pick flowers, or play at brigands among the trees, he always made the Rabbit a little nest somewhere among the bracken, where he would be quite cosy , for he was a kind-hearted little boy and he liked Bunny to be comfortable. One evening, while the Rabbit was lying there alone, watching the ants that ran to and fro between his velvet paws in the grass, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him. They were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand-new .",
  "They must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved; one minute they were long and thin and the next minute fat and bunchy , instead of always staying the same like he did. Their feet padded softly on the ground, and they crept quite close to him, twitching their noses, while the Rabbit stared hard to see which side the clockwork stuck out, for he knew that people who jump generally have something to wind them up.",
  "Sඝඕඕඍක Dඉඡඛ They stared at him, and the little Rabbit stared back. And all the time their noses twitched. \"Why don't you get up and play with us?\" one of them asked. \"I don't feel like it,\" said the Rabbit, for he didn't want to explain that he had no clockwork. \"Ho!\" said the furry rabbit.",
  "That was a dreadful question, for the V elveteen Rabbit had no hind legs at all! The back of him was made all in one piece, like a pincushion. He sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice. \"I don't want to!\" he said again.",
  "But the wild rabbits have very sharp eyes. And this one stretched out his neck and looked. \"He hasn't got any hind legs!\" he called out. \"Fancy a rabbit without any hind legs!\" And he began to laugh. \"I have!\" cried the little Rabbit. \"I have got hind legs! I am sitting on them!\"",
  "And he began to whirl round and dance, till the little Rabbit got quite dizzy . \"I don't like dancing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit still!\" But all the while he was longing to dance, for a funny new tickly feeling ran through him, and he felt he would give anything in the world to be able to jump about like these rabbits did. The strange rabbit stopped dancing, and came quite close. He came so close this time that his long whiskers brushed the V elveteen Rabbit's ear , and then he wrinkled his nose suddenly and flattened his ears and jumped backwards.",
  "He isn't real!\" \"I am Real!\" said the little Rabbit. \"I am Real! The Boy said so!\" And he nearly began to cry . Just then there was a sound of footsteps, and the Boy ran past near them, and with a stamp of feet and a flash of white tails the two strange rabbits disappeared. \"Come back and play with me!\" called the little Rabbit.",
  "I know I am Real!\" But there was no answer , only the little ants ran to and fro, and the bracken swayed gently where the two strangers had passed. The Velveteen Rabbit was all alone. \"Oh, dear!\" he thought. \"Why did they run away like that? Why couldn't they stop and talk to me?\"",
  "For a long time he lay very still, watching the bracken, and hoping that they would come back. But they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the Boy came and carried him home. Weeks passed, and the little Rabbit grew very old and shabby , but the Boy loved him just as much.",
  "He loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers of f, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey , and his brown spots faded. He even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the Boy . To him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little Rabbit cared about. He didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn't matter .",
  "And then, one day , the Boy was ill. His face grew very flushed, and he talked in his sleep, and his little body was so hot that it burned the Rabbit when he held him close. Strange people came and went in the nursery , and a light burned all night and through it all the little V elveteen Rabbit lay there, hidden from sight under the bedclothes, and he never stirred, for he was afraid that if they found him some one might take him away , and he knew that the Boy needed him. It was a long weary time, for the Boy was too ill to play , and the little Rabbit found it rather dull with nothing to do all day long. But he snuggled down patiently , and looked forward to the time when the Boy should be well again, and they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket like they used to. All sorts of delightful things he planned, and while the Boy lay half asleep he crept up close to the pillow and whispered them in his ear .",
  "And presently the fever turned, and the Boy got better . He was able to sit up in bed and look at picture-books, while the little Rabbit cuddled close at his side. And one day , they let him get up and dress. It was a bright, sunny morning, and the windows stood wide open.",
  "The Boy was going to the seaside to-morrow . Everything was arranged, and now it only remained to carry out the doctor's orders. They talked about it all, while the little Rabbit lay under the bedclothes, with just his head peeping out, and listened. The room was to be disinfected, and all the books and toys that the Boy had played with in bed must be burnt.",
  "For the boy had often talked of the seaside, and he wanted very much to see the big waves coming in, and the tiny crabs, and the sand castles. Just then Nana caught sight of him. \"How about his old Bunny?\" she asked. \" That? \" said the doctor .",
  "And so the little Rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture- books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl-house. That was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it.",
  "He had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather , but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot. That night the Boy slept in a dif ferent bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him. It was a splendid bunny , all white plush with real glass eyes, but the Boy was too excited to care very much about it.",
  "For to-morrow he was going to the seaside, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else. And while the Boy was asleep, dreaming of the seaside, the little Rabbit lay among the old picture-books in the corner behind the fowl- house, and he felt very lonely .",
  "The sack had been left untied, and so by wriggling a bit he was able to get his head through the opening and look out. He was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a proper bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him.",
  "Near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, growing tall and close like a tropical jungle, in whose shadow he had played with the Boy on bygone mornings. He thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden–how happy they were–and a great sadness came over him. He seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other , the fairy huts in the flower-bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws; the wonderful day when he first knew that he was Real.",
  "He thought of the Skin Horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him. Of what use was it to be loved and lose one's beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear , a real tear , trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground.",
  "And then a strange thing happened. For where the tear had fallen a flower grew out of the ground, a mysterious flower , not at all like any that grew in the garden. It had slender green leaves the colour of emeralds, and in the centre of the leaves a blossom like a golden cup.",
  "And presently the blossom opened, and out of it there stepped a fairy . She was quite the loveliest fairy in the whole world. Her dress was of pearl and dew-drops, and there were flowers round her neck and in her hair , and her face was like the most perfect flower of all.",
  "And she came close to the little Rabbit and gathered him up in her arms and kissed him on his velveteen nose that was all damp from crying. \"Little Rabbit,\" she said, \"don't you know who I am?\" The Rabbit looked up at her , and it seemed to him that he had seen her face before, but he couldn't think where.",
  "When they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then I come and take them away with me and turn them into Real.\" \"Wasn't I Real before?\" asked the little Rabbit. \"You were Real to the Boy ,\" the Fairy said, \"because he loved you.",
  "And she held the little Rabbit close in her arms and flew with him into the wood. It was light now , for the moon had risen. All the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver . In the open glade between the tree-trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the Fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her .",
  "And she kissed the little Rabbit again and put him down on the grass. \"Run and play , little Rabbit!\" she said. But the little Rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved. For when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he suddenly remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece.",
  "He did not know that when the Fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether . And he might have sat there a long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it. And he found that he actually had hind legs!",
  "Instead of dingy velveteen he had brown fur , soft and shiny , his ears twitched by themselves, and his whiskers were so long that they brushed the grass. He gave one leap and the joy of using those hind legs was so great that he went springing about the turf on them, jumping sideways and whirling round as the others did, and he grew so excited that when at last he did stop to look for the Fairy she had gone.",
  "Aග Lඉඛග! Aග Lඉඛග! Autumn passed and Winter , and in the Spring, when the days grew warm and sunny , the Boy went out to play in the wood behind the house. And while he was playing, two rabbits crept out from the bracken and peeped at him. One of them was brown all over , but the other had strange markings under his fur , as though long ago he had been spotted, and the spots still showed through.",
  "And about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar , so that the Boy thought to himself: \"Why , he looks just like my old Bunny that was lost when I had scarlet fever!\" But he never knew that it really was his own Bunny , come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be Real.",

BECAUSE IT'S YOURS—— BECAUSE WE LOVE YOU. INTRODUCTION If you happen to have read another book about Christopher Robin, you may remember that he once had a swan (or the swan had Christopher Robin, I don't know which) and that he used to call this swan Pooh.",
  "That was a long time ago, and when we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn't think the swan would want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear said that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christophe r Robin said at once, without stopping to think, that he was Winnie-the-Pooh.",
  "And he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh part, I will now explain the rest of it. You can't be in London for long without going to the Zoo. There are some people who begin the Zoo at the beginning, called WAYIN, and walk as quickly as they can past every cage until they get to the one called WAYOUT , but the nicest people go straight to the animal they love the most, and stay there.",
  "So when Christopher Robin goes to the Zoo, he goes to where the Polar Bears are, and he whispers something to the third keeper from the left, and doors are unlocked, and we wander through dark passages and up steep stairs, until at last we come to the special cage, and the cage is opened, and out trots something brown and furry , and with a happy cry of \"Oh, Bear!\" Christopher Robin rushes into its arms.",
  "Now this bear's name is Winnie, which shows what a good name for bears it is, but the funny thing is that we can't remember whether Winnie is called after Pooh, or Pooh after Winnie. We did know once, but we have for gotten.... I had written as far as this when Piglet looked up and said in his squeaky voice, \"What about Me?\" \"My dear Piglet,\" I said, \"the whole book is about you.\"",
  "You see what it is. He is jealous because he thinks Pooh is having a Grand Introduction all to himself. Pooh is the favourite, of course, there's no denying it, but Piglet comes in for a good many things which Pooh misses; because you can't take Pooh to school without everybody knowing it, but Piglet is so small that he slips into a pocket, where it is very comforting to feel him when you are not quite sure whether twice seven is twelve or twenty-two. Sometimes he slips out and has a good look in the ink-pot, and in this way he has got more education than Pooh, but Pooh doesn't mind.",
  "And now all the others are saying, \"Wha t about Us?\" So perhaps the best thing to do is to stop writing Introductions and get on with the book. A. A. M.

  "CHAPTER I IN WHICH WE ARE INTRODUCED TO WINNIE-THE-POOH AND SOME BEES, AND THE STORIES BEGIN Here is Edward Bear, coming downstair s now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin. It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.",
  "And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow , here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh. When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say , \"But I thought he was a boy?\" \"So did I,\" said Christopher Robin.",
  "Don't you know what ' ther' means?\" \"Ah, yes, now I do,\" I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is all the explanation you are going to get. Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downsta irs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story .",
  "So I tried. Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday , Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders. (\"What does 'under the name' mean?\" asked Christopher Robin. \"It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it. \"",
  "Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think. First of all he said to himself: \"That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something. If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee.\" Then he thought another long time, and said: \"And the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making honey .\" And then he got up, and said: \"And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it.\"",
  "He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this: Isn't it funny How a bear likes honey? Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! I wonder why he does? Then he climbed a little further ... and a little further ... and then just a little further .",
  "By that time he had thought of another song. It's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees, They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees. And that being so (if the Bees were Bears), We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs. He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complaining Song.",
  "He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that branch ... Crack! \"Oh, help!\" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him. \"If only I hadn't——\" he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch. \"You see, what I meant to do,\" he explained, as he turned head-over -heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below , \"what I meant to do——\" \"Of course, it was rather——\" he admitted, as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches. \"It all comes, I suppose,\" he decided, as he said good-bye to the last branch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush, \"it all comes of liking honey so much.",
  "He crawled out of the gorse-bush, brushed the prickles from his nose, and began to think again. And the first person he thought of was Christopher Robin. (\"Was that me?\" said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, har dly daring to believe it. \"That was you. \" Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got lar ger and lar ger, and his face got pinker and pinker .)",
  "I just said it to myself, thinking of balloons, and wondering.\" \"What do you want a balloon for?\" you said. Winnie-the-Pooh looked round to see that nobody was listening, put his paw to his mouth, and said in a deep whisper: \"Honey! \" \"But you don't get honey with balloons!\"",
  "Well, it just happened that you had been to a party the day before at the house of your friend Piglet, and you had balloons at the party . You had had a big green balloon; and one of Rabbit's relations had had a big blue one, and had left it behind, being really too young to go to a party at all; and so you had brought the green one and the blue one home with you.",
  "He put his head between his paws and thought very carefully . \"It's like this,\" he said. \"When you go after honey with a balloon, the great thing is not to let the bees know you're coming. Now , if you have a green ballo on, they might think you were only part of the tree, and not notice you, and, if you have a blue balloon, they might think you were only part of the sky, and not notice you, and the question is: Which is most likely?\" \"Wouldn't they notice you underneath the balloon?\"",
  "Well, you both went out with the blue balloon, and you took your gun with you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a very muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he was black all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big, and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go suddenly , and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed there—level with the top of the tree and about twenty feet away from it.",
  "And, as I say , you never can tell with bees.\" There was no wind to blow him nearer to the tree, so there he stayed. He could see the honey , he could smell the honey , but he couldn't quite reach the honey . After a little while he called down to you.",
  "You never can tell with bees.\" There was another little silence, and then he called down to you again. \"Christopher Robin!\" \"Yes?\" \"Have you an umbrella in your house?\" \"I think so.\" \"I wish you would bring it out here, and walk up and down with it, and look up at me every now and then, and say 'Tut- tut, it looks like rain.'",
  "I think, if you did that, it would help the deception which we are practising on these bees.\" Well, you laughed to yourself, \"Silly old Bear!\" but you didn't say it aloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your umbrella. \"Oh, there you are!\" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got back to the tree.",
  "We must be practical. The important bee to deceive is the Queen Bee. Can you see which is the Queen Bee from down there?\" \"No.\" \"A pity. Well, now, if you walk up and down with your umbrella, saying, 'Tut-tut, it looks like rain,' I shall do what I can by singing a little Cloud Song, such as a cloud might sing.... Go!\" So, while you walked up and down and wondered if it would rain, Winnie-the-Pooh sang this song: How sweet to be a Cloud Floating in the Blue! Every little cloud Always sings aloud.",
  "It makes him very proud To be a little cloud. The bees were still buzzing as suspiciously as ever. Some of them, indeed, left their nests and flew all round the cloud as it began the second verse of this song, and one bee sat down on the nose of the cloud for a moment, and then got up again.",
  "So I think I shall come down.\" \"How?\" asked you. Winnie-the-Pooh hadn't thought about this. If he let go of the string, he would fall— bump —and he didn't like the idea of that. So he thought for a long time, and then he said: \"Christopher Robin, you must shoot the balloon with your gun.",
  "Have you got your gun?\" \"Of course I have,\" you said. \"But if I do that, it will spoil the balloon,\" you said. \"But if you don't ,\" said Pooh, \"I shall have to let go, and that would spoil me.\" When he put it like this, you saw how it was, and you aimed very carefully at the balloon, and fired.",
  "But his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon all that time that they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think—but I am not sure—that that is why he was always called Pooh.",
  "There are others.\" \"About Pooh and Me?\" \"And Piglet and Rabbit and all of you. Don't you remember?\" \"I do remember , and then when I try to remember , I for get.\" \"That day when Pooh and Piglet tried to catch the Hef falump——\" \"They didn't catch it, did they?\"",
  "Did I catch it?\" \"Well, that comes into the story .\" Christopher Robin nodded. \"I do remember ,\" he said, \"only Pooh doesn't very well, so that's why he likes having it told to him again. Because then it's a real story and not just a remembering.\" \"That's just how I feel,\" I said.",
  "Christopher Robin gave a deep sigh, picked his Bear up by the leg, and walked off to the door, trailing Pooh behind him. At the door he turned and said, \"Coming to see me have my bath?\" \"I might,\" I said. \"I didn't hurt him when I shot him, did I?\"",
  "CHAPTER II IN WHICH POOH GOES VISITING AND GETS INTO A TIGHT PLACE Edward Bear, known to his friends as Winnie-the-Pooh, or Pooh for short, was walking through the forest one day, humming proudly to himself. He had made up a little hum that very morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la , as he stretched up as high as he could go, and then Tra-la-la, tra-la—oh, help!—la , as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart, and now he was humming it right through, properly .",
  "Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily , wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank was a lar ge hole. \"Aha!\" said Pooh. (Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum. ) \"If I know anything about anything, that hole means Rabbit,\" he said, \"and Rabbit means Company ,\" he said, \"and Company means Food and Listening-to-Me-Humming and such like.",
  "Rum-tum- tum-tiddle-um. \" So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out: \"Is anybody at home?\" There was a sudden scuf fling noise from inside the hole, and then silence. \"What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'\" called out Pooh very loudly . \"No!\" said a voice; and then added, \"Y ou needn't shout so loud.",
  "I heard you quite well the first time.\" \"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"Isn't there anybody here at all?\" \"Nobody .\" Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little, and he thought to himself, \"There must be somebody there, because somebody must have said 'Nobody .'\" So he put his head back in the hole, and said: \"Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you?\" \"No,\" said Rabbit, in a dif ferent sort of voice this time. \"But isn't that Rabbit's voice?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Rabbit.",
  "So Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at last he got in. \"You were quite right,\" said Rabbit, looking at him all over . \"It is you. Glad to see you.\" \"Who did you think it was?\" \"Well, I wasn't sure. You know how it is in the Forest.",
  "One can't have anybody coming into one's house. One has to be careful. What about a mouthful of something?\" Pooh always liked a little something at eleven o'clock in the morning, and he was very glad to see Rabbit getting out the plates and mugs; and when Rabbit said, \"Honey or condensed milk with your bread?\"",
  "And for a long time after that he said nothing ... until at last, humming to himself in a rather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and said that he must be going on. \"Must you?\" said Rabbit politely . \"Well,\" said Pooh, \"I could stay a little longer if it—if you——\" and he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder .",
  "So he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws, and pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in the open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ... and then his shoulders ... and then —— \"Oh, help!\" said Pooh.",
  "Now by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the front door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh, and looked at him. \"Hallo, are you stuck?\" he asked. \"N-no,\" said Pooh carelessly . \"Just resting and thinking and humming to myself.\"",
  "I thought at the time,\" said Rabbit, \"only I didn't like to say anything,\" said Rabbit, \"that one of us was eating too much,\" said Rabbit, \"and I knew it wasn't me,\" he said. \"Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher Robin.\" Christopher Robin lived at the other end of the Forest, and when he came back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, \"Silly old Bear ,\" in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again. \"I was just beginning to think,\" said Bear, sniffing slightly , \"that Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again.",
  "And I should hate that,\" he said. \"So should I,\" said Rabbit. \"Use his front door again?\" said Christopher Robin. \"Of course he'll use his front door again.\" \"Good,\" said Rabbit. \"If we can't pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back.\" Rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully , and pointed out that, when once Pooh was pushed back, he was back, and of course nobody was more glad to see Pooh than he was, still there it was, some lived in trees and some lived under ground, and—— \"You mean I'd never get out?\" said Pooh. \"I mean,\" said Rabbit, \"that having got so far, it seems a pity to waste it.\"",
  "Christopher Robin nodded. \"Then there's only one thing to be done,\" he said. \"W e shall have to wait for you to get thin again.\" \"How long does getting thin take?\" asked Pooh anxiously . \"About a week, I should think.\" \"But I can't stay here for a week !\" \"You can stay here all right, silly old Bear .",
  "It's getting you out which is so dif ficult.\" \"We'll read to you,\" said Rabbit cheerfully . \"And I hope it won't snow ,\" he added . \"And I say, old fellow , you're taking up a good deal of room in my house— do you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse?",
  "Because, I mean, there they are —doing nothing—and it would be very convenient just to hang the towels on them.\" \"A week!\" said Pooh gloomily . \"What about meals? \" \"I'm afraid no meals,\" said Christopher Robin, \"because of getting thin quicker . But we will read to you.\" Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn't because he was so tightly stuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he said: \"Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?\"",
  "So for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end of Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end ... and in between Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer . And at the end of the week Christopher Robin said, \" Now! \" So he took hold of Pooh's front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher Robin, and all Rabbit's friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and they all pulled together ....",
  "And then, all of a sudden, he said \" Pop! \" just as if a cork were coming out of a bottle. And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit's friends and relations went head-over -heels backwards ... and on the top of them came Winnie-the-Pooh—free! So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk through the forest, humming proudly to himself.",
  "But, Christopher Robin looked after him lovingly , and said to himself, \"Silly old Bear!\" CHAPTER III IN WHICH POOH AND PIGLET GO HUNTING AND NEARLY CATCH A WOOZLE The Piglet lived in a very grand house in the middle of a beech-tree, and the beech-tree was in the middle of the forest, and the Piglet lived in the middle of the house.",
  "Next to his house was a piece of broken board which had: \"TRESP ASSERS W\" on it. When Christopher Robin asked the Piglet what it meant, he said it was his grandfather's name, and had been in the family for a long time, Christopher Robin said you couldn't be called Trespassers W, and Piglet said yes, you could, because his grandfather was, and it was short for Trespassers Will, which was short for Trespassers William. And his grandfather had had two names in case he lost one—T respassers after an uncle, and William after Trespassers.",
  "I ask myself, What?\" \"What do you think you'll answer?\" \"I shall have to wait until I catch up with it,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"Now , look there.\" He pointed to the ground in front of him. \"What do you see there?\" \"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a little squeak of excitement.",
  "Do you think it's a—a—a Woozle?\" \"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You never can tell with paw-marks.\" With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him for a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the- Pooh had come to a sudden stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way .",
  "This—whatever -it-was—has been joined by another—whatever -it-is—and the two of them are now proceeding in company . Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they turn out to be Hostile Animals?\" Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had nothing to do until Friday , and would be delighted to come, in case it really was a Woozle. \"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday .",
  "There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath, and other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and, if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and what Christopher Robin would say.",
  "And still the tracks went on in front of them.... Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him. \" Look! \" \"What? \" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an exercising sort of way .",
  "A third animal has joined the other two! \" \"Pooh!\" cried Piglet. \"Do you think it is another Woozle?\" \"No,\" said Pooh, \"because it makes different marks. It is either Two Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles and one, if so it is, Woozle.",
  "Let us continue to follow them.\" So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly but quite accidentally , and only because he liked Christopher Robin so much.",
  "And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner , for he was feeling more hot and anxious than ever in his life before. There wer e four animals in fr ont of them! \"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks!",
  "Three, as it were, Woozles, and one, as it was, Wizzle. Another Woozle has joined them! \" And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.",
  "So I suppose I really ought to go back and do it now .\" \"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh. \"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet quickly . \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of——What would you say the time was?\"",
  "So, really , dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me—— What's that? \" Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend of his. \"It's Christopher Robin,\" he said.",
  "Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree. \"Silly old Bear,\" he said, \"what were you doing? First you went round the spinney twice by yourself, and then Pigle t ran after you and you went round again together , and then you were just going round a fourth time——\" \"Wait a moment,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw .",
  "He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his nose twice, and stood up. \"Yes,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"I see now ,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"I have been Foolish and Deluded,\" said he, \"and I am a Bear of No Brain at All.\"",
  "And then he brightened up suddenly . \"Anyhow ,\" he said, \"it is nearly Luncheon Time.\" So he went home for it. CHAPTER IV IN WHICH EEYORE LOSES A TAIL AND POOH FINDS ONE The Old Grey Donkey , Eeyore, stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest, his front feet well apart, his head on one side, and thought about things.",
  "Eeyore shook his head from side to side. \"Not very how ,\" he said. \"I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time.\" \"Dear , dear ,\" said Pooh, \"I'm sorry about that. Let's have a look at you.\" So Eeyore stood there, gazing sadly at the ground, and Winnie-the-Pooh walked all round him once.",
  "No Wonder .\" \"You must have left it somewhere,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh. \"Somebody must have taken it,\" said Eeyore. \"How Like Them,\" he added, after a long silence. Pooh felt that he ought to say somethin g helpful about it, but didn't quite know what. So he decided to do something helpful instead.",
  "So Winnie-the-Pooh went of f to find Eeyore's tail. It was a fine spring morning in the forest as he started out. Little soft clouds played happily in a blue sky, skipping from time to time in front of the sun as if they had come to put it out, and then sliding away suddenly so that the next might have his turn.",
  "Through them and between them the sun shone bravely; and a copse which had worn its firs all the year round seemed old and dowdy now beside the new green lace which the beeches had put on so prettily . Through copse and spinney marched Bear; down open slopes of gorse and heather , over rocky beds of streams, up steep banks of sandstone into the heather again; and so at last, tired and hungry , to the Hundred Acre Wood.",
  "For it was in the Hundred Acre Wood that Owl lived. \"And if anyone knows anything about anything,\" said Bear to himself, \"it's Owl who knows something about something,\" he said, \"or my name's not Winnie-the-Pooh,\" he said. \"Which it is,\" he added. \"So there you are.\" Owl lived at The Chestnuts, an old-world residence of great charm, which was grander than anybody else's, or seemed so to Bear , because it had both a knocker and a bell-pull.",
  "These notices had been written by Christopher Robin, who was the only one in the forest who could spell; for Owl, wise though he was in many ways, able to read and write and spell his own name WOL, yet somehow went all to pieces over delicate words like MEASLES and BUTTEREDT OAST .",
  "Winnie-the-Pooh read the two notices very carefully , first from left to right, and afterwards, in case he had missed some of it, from right to left. Then, to make quite sure, he knocked and pulled the knocker , and he pulled and knocked the bell- rope, and he called out in a very loud voice, \"Owl!",
  "I require an answer! It's Bear speaking.\" And the door opened, and Owl looked out. \"Hallo, Pooh,\" he said. \"How's things?\" \"Terrible and Sad,\" said Pooh, \"because Eeyore, who is a friend of mine, has lost his tail. And he's Moping about it. So could you very kindly tell me how to find it for him?\"",
  "First, Issue a Reward. Then——\" \"Just a moment,\" said Pooh, holding up his paw. \"What do we do to this—what you were saying? You sneezed just as you were going to tell me.\" \"I didn't sneeze.\" \"Yes, you did, Owl.\" \"Excuse me, Pooh, I didn't. You can't sneeze without knowing it.\" \"Well, you can't know it without something having been sneezed.\"",
  "And he gave a deep sigh, and tried very hard to listen to what Owl was saying. But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he came back to where he started, and he explained that the person to write out this notice was Christopher Robin.",
  "Did you see them, Pooh?\" For some time now Pooh had been saying \"Yes\" and \"No\" in turn, with his eyes shut, to all that Owl was saying, and having said, \"Y es, yes,\" last time, he said \"No, not at all,\" now , without really knowing what Owl was talking about. \"Didn't you see them?\" said Owl, a little surprised. \"Come and look at them now .\"",
  "So they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen something like it, somewhere else, sometime before. \"Handsome bell-rope, isn't it?\" said Owl.",
  "It was hanging over a bush, and I thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing happened, and then I rang it again very loudly , and it came off in my hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and——\" \"Owl,\" said Pooh solemnly , \"you made a mistake.",
  "So with these words he unhooked it, and carried it back to Eeyore; and when Christopher Robin had nailed it on in its right place again, Eeyore frisked about the forest, waving his tail so happily that Winnie-the-Pooh came over all funny , and had to hurry home for a little snack of something to sustain him.",
  "One day, when Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh and Piglet were all talking together , Christopher Robin finished the mouthful he was eating and said carelessly: \"I saw a Hef falump to-day , Piglet.\" \"What was it doing?\" asked Piglet. \"Just lumping along,\" said Christopher Robin. \"I don't think it saw me.\"",
  "Then they all talked about something else, until it was time for Pooh and Piglet to go home together . At first as they stumped along the path which edged the Hundred Acre Wood, they didn't say much to each other; but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the stepping stones, and were able to walk side by side again over the heather , they began to talk in a friendly way about this and that, and Piglet said, \"If you see what I mean, Pooh,\" and Pooh said, \"It's just what I think myself, Piglet,\" and Piglet said, \"But, on the other hand, Pooh, we must remember ,\" and Pooh said, \"Quite true, Piglet, although I had forgotten it for the moment.\" And then, just as they came to the Six Pine Trees, Pooh looked round to see that nobody else was listening, and said in a very solemn voice: \"Piglet, I have decided something.\" \"What have you decided, Pooh?\"",
  "Pooh nodded his head several times as he said this, and waited for Piglet to say \"How?\" or \"Pooh, you couldn't!\" or something helpful of that sort, but Piglet said nothing. The fact was Piglet was wishing that he had thought about it first. \"I shall do it,\" said Pooh, after waiting a little longer , \"by means of a trap.",
  "And it must be a Cunning Trap, so you will have to help me, Piglet.\" \"Pooh,\" said Piglet, feeling quite happy again now, \"I will.\" And then he said, \"How shall we do it?\" and Pooh said, \"That's just it. How?\" And then they sat down together to think it out.",
  "Pooh's first idea was that they should dig a Very Deep Pit, and then the Heffalump would come along and fall into the Pit, and—— \"Why?\" said Piglet. \"Why what?\" said Pooh. \"Why would he fall in?\" Pooh rubbed his nose with his paw, and said that the Heffalump might be walking along, humming a little song, and looking up at the sky, wondering if it would rain, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down, when it would be too late.",
  "Piglet said that this was a very good Trap, but supposing it were raining already? Pooh rubbed his nose again, and said that he hadn't thought of that. And then he brightened up, and said that, if it were raining already , the Heffalump would be looking at the sky wondering if it would clear up, and so he wouldn't see the Very Deep Pit until he was half-way down....",
  "When it would be too late. Piglet said that, now that this point had been explained, he thought it was a Cunning Trap. Pooh was very proud when he heard this, and he felt that the Heffalump was as good as caught already , but there was just one other thing which had to be thought about, and it was this.",
  "Wher e should they dig the V ery Deep Pit? Piglet said that the best place would be somewhere where a Heffalump was, just before he fell into it, only about a foot farther on. \"But then he would see us digging it,\" said Pooh. \"Not if he was looking at the sky .\" \"He would Suspect,\" said Pooh, \"if he happened to look down.\"",
  "He thought for a long time and then added sadly , \"It isn't as easy as I thought. I suppose that's why Hef falumps hardly ever get caught.\" \"That must be it,\" said Piglet. They sighed and got up; and when they had taken a few gorse prickles out of themselves they sat down again; and all the time Pooh was saying to himself, \"If only I could think of something!\"",
  "I should make a Trap, and I should put a Jar of Honey in the Trap, and you would smell it, and you would go in after it, and——\" \"And I would go in after it,\" said Pooh excitedly , \"only very carefully so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey , and I should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't any more, you know , and then I should walk away and think about it a little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of the jar, and then——\" \"Yes, well never mind about that.",
  "There you would be, and there I should catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Hef falumps like? I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of——I say , wake up, Pooh!\" Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't think so; and they were just going to argue about it, when Piglet remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, he would have to find the acorns, but if they put honey , then Pooh would have to give up some of his own honey , so he said, \"All right, honey then,\" just as Pooh remembered it too, and was going to say, \"All right, haycorns.\" \"Honey ,\" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now settled. \"I'll dig the pit, while you go and get the honey .\"",
  "It had HUNNY written on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and looked at it, and it looked just like honey . \"But you never can tell,\" said Pooh. \"I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just this colour .\"",
  "So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. \"Yes,\" he said, \"it is. No doubt about that. And honey , I should say, right down to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,\" he said, \"somebody put cheese in at the bottom just for a joke.",
  "Perhaps I had better go a little further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps don't like cheese ... same as me.... Ah!\" And he gave a deep sigh. \"I was right. It is honey , right the way down.\" Having made certain of this, he took the jar back to Piglet, and Piglet looked up from the bottom of his Very Deep Pit, and said, \"Got it?\" and Pooh said, \"Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar,\" and he threw it down to Piglet, and Piglet said, \"No, it isn't!",
  "Is that all you've got left?\" and Pooh said \"Yes.\" Because it was. So Piglet put the jar at the bottom of the Pit, and climbed out, and they went of f home together . \"Well, good night, Pooh,\" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's house. \"And we meet at six o'clock to-morrow morning by the Pine Trees, and see how many Hef falumps we've got in our Trap.\"",
  "You never can tell with Hef falumps. Well, good night!\" \"Good night!\" And of f Piglet trotted to his house TRESP ASSERS W, while Pooh made his preparations for bed. Some hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away , Pooh woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling before, and he knew what it meant.",
  "He was hungry . So he went to the larder , and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and found—nothing. \"That's funny ,\" he thought. \"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it, so that I should know it was honey .",
  "That's very funny .\" And then he began to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a murmur to himself. Like this: It's very , very funny , 'Cos I know I had some honey; 'Cos it had a label on, Saying HUNNY . A goloptious full-up pot too,",
  "And I don't know where it's got to, No, I don't know where it's gone— Well, it's funny . He had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way, when suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to catch the Hef falump.",
  "And he got back into bed. But he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn't. He tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to sleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that was worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight for a pot of Pooh's honey , and eating it all. For some minutes he lay there miserably , but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, \"Very good honey this, I don't know when I've tasted better ,\" Pooh could bear it no longer .",
  "The Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the Hundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked cold and lonely , and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and Pooh's jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and no more.",
  "But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed honey , and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready for it. \"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. \"A Heffalump has been eating it!\" And then he thought a little and said, \"Oh, no, I did.",
  "I for got.\" Indeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to lick.... By and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke he said to himself, \"Oh!\"",
  "What was a Hef falump like? Was it Fierce? Did it come when you whistled? And how did it come? Was it Fond of Pigs at all? If it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any dif ference what sort of Pig ? Supposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference if the Pig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM ?",
  "He didn't know the answer to any of these questions ... and he was going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now! Of course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with two. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs and Bears?",
  "Wouldn't it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go up to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a very fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be, in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing.",
  "What should he do? And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six Pine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there was a Hef falump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and if there wasn't, he wouldn't.",
  "So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffalump in the Trap, and then he thought that there would, and as he got nearer he was sure that there would, because he could hear it hef falumping about it like anything. \"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!\" said Piglet to himself.",
  "And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck. \"Bother! \" he said, inside the jar, and \"Oh, help! \" and, mostly , \"Ow!\" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see what he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much of that, he couldn't find his way.",
  "So at last he lifted up his head, jar and all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and it was at that moment that Piglet looked down. \"Help, help!\" cried Piglet, \"a Heffalump , a Horrible Heffalump!\" and he scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, \"Help, help, a Herrible Hoffalump!",
  "Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a Hoffable Hellerump!\" And he didn't stop crying and scampering until he got to Christopher Robin's house. \"Whatever's the matter , Piglet?\" said Christopher Robin, who was just getting up. \"Hef f,\" said Piglet, breathing so hard that he could hardly speak, \"a Hef f—a Hef f—a Hef falump.\"",
  "A great enormous thing, like—like nothing. A huge big—well, like a—I don't know—like an enormous big nothing. Like a jar .\" \"Well,\" said Christopher Robin, putting on his shoes, \"I shall go and look at it. Come on.\" Piglet wasn't afraid if he had Christopher Robin with him, so of f they went....",
  "It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found. \"There!\" said Piglet. \"Isn't it awful ?\" And he held on tight to Christopher Robin's hand. Suddenly Christopher Robin began to laugh ... and he laughed ... and he laughed ... and he laughed. And while he was still laughing— Crash went the Heffalump's head against the tree-root, Smash went the jar, and out came Pooh's head again....",
  "Then Piglet saw what a Foolish Piglet he had been, and he was so ashamed of himself that he ran straight off home and went to bed with a headache. But Christopher Robin and Pooh went home to breakfast together . \"Oh, Bear!\" said Christopher Robin. \"How I do love you!\"",
  "CHAPTER VI IN WHICH EEYORE HAS A BIRTHDAY AND GETS TWO PRESENTS Eeyore, the old grey Donkey , stood by the side of the stream, and looked at himself in the water . \"Pathetic,\" he said. \"That's what it is. Pathetic.\" He turned and walked slowly down the stream for twenty yards, splashed across it, and walked slowly back on the other side.",
  "Then he looked at himself in the water again. \"As I thought,\" he said. \"No better from this side. But nobody minds. Nobody cares. Pathetic, that's what it is.\" There was a crackling noise in the bracken behind him, and out came Pooh. \"Good morning, Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"Good morning, Pooh Bear ,\" said Eeyore gloomily . \"If it is a good morning,\" he said.",
  "He thought for a long time, and then asked, \"What mulberry bush is that?\" \"Bon-hommy ,\" went on Eeyore gloomily . \"French word meaning bonhommy ,\" he explained. \"I'm not complaining, but There It Is.\" Pooh sat down on a large stone, and tried to think this out. It sounded to him like a riddle, and he was never much good at riddles, being a Bear of Very Little Brain.",
  "So he sang Cottleston Pie instead: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, A fly can't bird, but a bird can fly . Ask me a riddle and I reply: \"Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie. \" That was the first verse. When he had finished it, Eeyore didn't actually say that he didn't like it, so Pooh very kindly sang the second verse to him: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, A fish can't whistle and neither can I. Ask me a riddle and I reply: \"Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie .\" Eeyore still said nothing at all, so Pooh hummed the third verse quietly to himself: Cottleston, Cottleston, Cottleston Pie, Why does a chicken, I don't know why .",
  "Umty-tiddly , umty-too. Here we go gathering Nuts and May . Enjoy yourself.\" \"I am,\" said Pooh. \"Some can,\" said Eeyore. \"Why , what's the matter?\" \"Is anything the matter?\" \"You seem so sad, Eeyore.\" \"Sad? Why should I be sad? It's my birthday . The happiest day of the year .\"",
  "Can't you see? Look at all the presents I have had.\" He waved a foot from side to side. \"Look at the birthday cake. Candles and pink sugar .\" Pooh looked—first to the right and then to the left. \"Presents?\" said Pooh. \"Birthday cake?\" said Pooh. \" Wher e?\" \"Can't you see them?\"",
  "Pooh scratched his head, being a little puzzled by all this. \"But is it really your birthday?\" he asked. \"It is.\" \"Oh! Well, Many happy returns of the day , Eeyore.\" \"And many happy returns to you, Pooh Bear .\" \"But it isn't my birthday .\" \"No, it's mine.\" \"But you said 'Many happy returns'——\" \"Well, why not?",
  "You don't always want to be miserable on my birthday , do you?\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh. \"It's bad enough,\" said Eeyore, almost breaking down, \"being miserable myself , what with no presents and no cake and no candles, and no proper notice taken of me at all, but if everybody else is going to be miserable too——\" This was too much for Pooh.",
  "Outside his house he found Piglet, jumping up and down trying to reach the knocker . \"Hallo, Piglet,\" he said. \"Hallo, Pooh,\" said Piglet. \"What are you trying to do?\" \"I was trying to reach the knocker ,\" said Piglet. \"I just came round——\" \"Let me do it for you,\" said Pooh kindly .",
  "So he reached up and knocked at the door. \"I have just seen Eeyore,\" he began, \"and poor Eeyore is in a Very Sad Condition, because it's his birthday , and nobody has taken any notice of it, and he's very Gloomy—you know what Eeyore is—and there he was, and——What a long time whoever lives here is answering this door .\"",
  "And he knocked again. \"But Pooh,\" said Piglet, \"it's your own house!\" \"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"W ell, let's go in.\" So in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to see if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it down.",
  "What are you going to give?\" \"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\" \"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would not be a good plan.\" \"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my party . I'll go and get it now , shall I?\"",
  "It is just what Eeyore wants to cheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\" So of f Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his jar of honey . It was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than half-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him.",
  "It began at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the soles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying, \"Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.\" \"Dear , dear,\" said Pooh, \"I didn't know it was as late as that.\"",
  "Ah, yes, Eeyore.\" He got up slowly . And then, suddenly , he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday present! \"Bother! \" said Pooh. \"What shall I do? I must give him something .\" For a little while he couldn't think of anything. Then he thought: \"Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I washed it clean, and got somebody to write 'A Happy Birthday ' on it, Eeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful.\"",
  "So, as he was just passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who lived there. \"Good morning, Owl,\" he said. \"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl. \"Many happy returns of Eeyore's birthday ,\" said Pooh. \"Oh, is that what it is?\" \"What are you giving him, Owl?\" \"What are you giving him, Pooh?\" \"I'm giving him a Useful Pot to Keep Things In, and I wanted to ask you——\" \"Is this it?\" said Owl, taking it out of Pooh's paw . \"Yes, and I wanted to ask you——\" \"Somebody has been keeping honey in it,\" said Owl.",
  "And I wanted to ask you——\" \"You ought to write ' A Happy Birthday ' on it.\" \"That was what I wanted to ask you,\" said Pooh. \"Because my spelling is Wobbly . It's good spelling but it Wobbles, and the letters get in the wrong places. Would you write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?\"",
  "From both of us?\" \"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would not be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it first, and then you can write on it.\" Well, he washed the pot out, and dried it, while Owl licked the end of his pencil, and wondered how to spell \"birthday .\"",
  "So Owl wrote ... and this is what he wrote: HIPY PAPY BTHUTHDTH THUTHDA BTHUTHDY . Pooh looked on admiringly . \"I'm just saying 'A Happy Birthday',\" said Owl carelessly . \"It's a nice long one,\" said Pooh, very much impressed by it. \"Well, actually , of course, I'm saying 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh.'",
  "Naturally it takes a good deal of pencil to say a long thing like that.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said Pooh. While all this was happening, Piglet had gone back to his own house to get Eeyore's balloon. He held it very tightly against himself, so that it shouldn't blow away , and he ran as fast as he could so as to get to Eeyore before Pooh did; for he thought that he would like to be the first one to give a present, just as if he had thought of it without being told by anybody . And running along, and thinking how pleased Eeyore would be, he didn't look where he was going ... and suddenly he put his foot in a rabbit hole, and fell down flat on his face.",
  "And then he thought, \"Well, even if I'm in the moon, I needn't be face downwards all the time,\" so he got cautiously up and looked about him. He was still in the Forest! \"Well, that's funny ,\" he thought. \"I wonder what that bang was. I couldn't have made such a noise just falling down.",
  "And where's my balloon? And what's that small piece of damp rag doing?\" It was the balloon! \"Oh, dear!\" said Piglet \"Oh, dear, oh, dearie, dearie, dear! Well, it's too late now. I can't go back, and I haven't another balloon, and perhaps Eeyore doesn't like balloons so very much.\"",
  "So he trotted on, rather sadly now , and down he came to the side of the stream where Eeyore was, and called out to him. \"Good morning, Eeyore,\" shouted Piglet. \"Good morning, Little Piglet,\" said Eeyore. \"If it is a good morning,\" he said. \"Which I doubt,\" said he. \"Not that it matters,\" he said.",
  "Eeyore stopped looking at himself in the stream, and turned to stare at Piglet. \"Just say that again,\" he said. \"Many hap——\" \"Wait a moment.\" Balancing on three legs, he began to bring his fourth leg very cautiously up to his ear. \"I did this yesterday ,\" he explained, as he fell down for the third time.",
  "It's so as I can hear better .... There, that's done it! Now then, what were you saying?\" He pushed his ear forward with his hoof. \"Many happy returns of the day ,\" said Piglet again. \"Meaning me?\" \"Of course, Eeyore.\" \"My birthday?\" \"Yes.\" \"Me having a real birthday?\" \"Yes, Eeyore, and I've brought you a present.\"",
  "One of those big coloured things you blow up? Gaiety , song-and-dance, here we are and there we are?\" \"Yes, but I'm afraid—I'm very sorry , Eeyore—but when I was running along to bring it you, I fell down.\" \"Dear , dear , how unlucky! You ran too fast, I expect.",
  "You didn't hurt yourself, Little Piglet?\" \"No, but I—I—oh, Eeyore, I burst the balloon!\" There was a very long silence. \"My balloon?\" said Eeyore at last. Piglet nodded. \"My birthday balloon?\" \"Yes, Eeyore,\" said Piglet sniffing a little. \"Here it is. With—with many happy returns of the day.\" And he gave Eeyore the small piece of damp rag. \"Is this it?\" said Eeyore, a little surprised.",
  "Red,\" he murmured to himself. \"My favourite colour .... How big was it?\" \"About as big as me.\" \"I just wondered.... About as big as Piglet,\" he said to himself sadly . \"My favourite size. Well, well.\" Piglet felt very miserable, and didn't know what to say. He was still opening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn't any good saying that, when he heard a shout from the other side of the river , and there was Pooh. \"Many happy returns of the day ,\" called out Pooh, for getting that he had said it already . \"Thank you, Pooh, I'm having them,\" said Eeyore gloomily . \"I've brought you a little present,\" said Pooh excitedly .",
  "Pooh had now splashed across the stream to Eeyore, and Piglet was sitting a little way off, his head in his paws, snuffling to himself. \"It's a Useful Pot,\" said Pooh. \"Here it is. And it's got 'A Very Happy Birthday with love from Pooh' written on it. That's what all that writing is.",
  "And it's for putting things in. There!\" When Eeyore saw the pot, he became quite excited. \"Why!\" he said. \"I believe my Balloon will just go into that Pot!\" \"Oh, no, Eeyore,\" said Pooh. \"Balloons are much too big to go into Pots. What you do with a balloon is, you hold the ballon——\" \"Not mine,\" said Eeyore proudly .",
  "And as Piglet looked sorrowfully round, Eeyore picked the balloon up with his teeth, and placed it carefully in the pot; picked it out and put it on the ground; and then picked it up again and put it carefully back. \"So it does!\" said Pooh. \"It goes in!\" \"So it does!\" said Piglet. \"And it comes out!\"",
  "He had a cake with icing on the top, and three candles, and his name in pink sugar , and——\" \"Yes, I remember ,\" said Christopher Robin. CHAPTER VII IN WHICH KANGA AND BABY ROO COME TO THE FOREST, AND PIGLET HAS A BATH Nobody seemed to know where they came from, but there they were in the Forest: Kanga and Baby Roo.",
  "When Pooh asked Christopher Robin, \"How did they come here?\" Christopher Robin said, \"In the Usual Way, if you know what I mean, Pooh,\" and Pooh, who didn't, said \"Oh!\" Then he nodded his head twice and said, \"In the Usual Way. Ah!\" Then he went to call upon his friend Piglet to see what he thought about it. And at Piglet's house he found Rabbit.",
  "We find a Strange Animal among us. An animal of whom we have never even heard before! An animal who carries her family about with her in her pocket! Suppose I carried my family about with me in my pocket, how many pockets should I want?\" \"Sixteen,\" said Piglet. \"Seventeen, isn't it?\" said Rabbit.",
  "Eighteen pockets in one suit! I haven't time.\" There was a long and thoughtful silence ... and then Pooh, who had been frowning very hard for some minutes, said: \"I make it fifteen.\" \"What?\" said Rabbit. \"Fifteen.\" \"Fifteen what?\" \"Your family .\" \"What about them?\" Pooh rubbed his nose and said that he thought Rabbit had been talking about his family . \"Did I?\" said Rabbit carelessly .",
  "The best way would be to steal Baby Roo and hide him, and then when Kanga says, 'Where's Baby Roo?' we say , 'Aha! '\" \"Aha! \" said Pooh, practising. \"Aha! Aha! ... Of course,\" he went on, \"we could say 'Aha!' even if we hadn't stolen Baby Roo.\" \"Pooh,\" said Rabbit kindly , \"you haven't any brain.\" \"I know ,\" said Pooh humbly .",
  "Now don't talk while I think.\" Pooh went into a corner and tried saying 'Aha!' in that sort of voice. Sometimes it seemed to him that it did mean what Rabbit said, and sometimes it seemed to him that it didn't. \"I suppose it's just practice,\" he thought. \"I wonder if Kanga will have to practise too so as to understand it.\"",
  "I am not frightened of Fierce Animals in the ordinary way, but it is well known that, if One of the Fiercer Animals is Deprived of Its Young, it becomes as fierce as Two of the Fiercer Animals. In which case ' Aha! ' is perhaps a foolish thing to say .\"",
  "Rabbit, who had begun to write very busily , looked up and said: \"It is because you are a very small animal that you will be Useful in the adventure before us.\" Piglet was so excited at the idea of being Useful, that he forgot to be frightened any more, and when Rabbit went on to say that Kangas were only Fierce during the winter months, being at other times of an Affectionate Disposition, he could hardly sit still, he was so eager to begin being useful at once.",
  "But Pooh went into a corner of the room and said proudly to himself, \"Impossible without Me! That sort of Bear .\" \"Now listen all of you,\" said Rabbit when he had finished writing, and Pooh and Piglet sat listening very eagerly with their mouths open. This was what Rabbit read out: PLAN TO CAPTURE BABY ROO 1.General Remarks.",
  "Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me. 2.More General Remarks. Kanga never takes her eye of f Baby Roo, except when he's safely buttoned up in her pocket. 3.Therefore. If we are to capture Baby Roo, we must get a Long Start, because Kanga runs faster than any of Us, even Me.",
  "Thought. If Roo had jumped out of Kanga's pocket and Piglet had jumped in, Kanga wouldn't know the dif ference, because Piglet is a Very Small Animal. 5.Like Roo. 6.But Kanga would have to be looking the other way first, so as not to see Piglet jumping in. 7.See 2. 8.Another Thought.",
  "Well, Rabbit read this out proudly , and for a little while after he had read it nobody said anything. And then Piglet, who had been opening and shutting his mouth without making any noise, managed to say very huskily: \"And—Afterwards?\" \"How do you mean?\" \"When Kanga does Discover the Dif ference?\"",
  "As long as we all three say it,\" said Piglet, \"I don't mind,\" he said, \"but I shouldn't care to say 'Aha! ' by myself. It wouldn't sound nearly so well. By the way,\" he said, \"you are quite sure about what you said about the winter months?\" \"The winter months?\" \"Yes, only being Fierce in the Winter Months.\"",
  "Well, Pooh? You see what you have to do?\" \"No,\" said Pooh Bear . \"Not yet,\" he said. \"What do I do?\" \"Well, you just have to talk very hard to Kanga so as she doesn't notice anything.\" \"Oh! What about?\" \"Anything you like.\" \"You mean like telling her a little bit of poetry or something?\"",
  "Now come along.\" So they all went out to look for Kanga. Kanga and Roo were spending a quiet afternoon in a sandy part of the Forest. Baby Roo was practising very small jumps in the sand, and falling down mouse-holes and climbing out of them, and Kanga was fidgeting about and saying \"Just one more jump, dear , and then we must go home.\"",
  "Good afternoon, Piglet.\" Rabbit and Piglet, who had now come up from the other side of the hill, said \"Good afternoon,\" and \"Hallo, Roo,\" and Roo asked them to look at him jumping, so they stayed and looked. And Kanga looked too.... \"Oh, Kanga,\" said Pooh, after Rabbit had winked at him twice, \"I don't know if you are interested in Poetry at all?\" \"Hardly at all,\" said Kanga.",
  "There was a short silence while Roo fell down another mouse-hole. \"Go on,\" said Rabbit in a loud whisper behind his paw . \"Talking of Poetry ,\" said Pooh, \"I made up a little piece as I was coming along. It went like this. Er—now let me see ——\" \"Fancy!\" said Kanga.",
  "On Tuesday , when it hails and snows, The feeling on me grows and grows That hardly anybody knows If those are these or these are those. On Wednesday , when the sky is blue, And I have nothing else to do, I sometimes wonder if it's true That who is what",
  "On Thursday , when it starts to freeze And hoar -frost twinkles on the trees, How very readily one sees That these are whose—but whose are these? On Friday—— \"Yes, it is, isn't it?\" said Kanga, not waiting to hear what happened on Friday . \"Just one more jump, Roo, dear, and then we really must be going.\"",
  "Rabbit gave Pooh a hurrying-up sort of nudge. \"Talking of Poetry ,\" said Pooh quickly , \"have you ever noticed that tree right over there?\" \"Where?\" said Kanga. \"Now , Roo——\" \"Right over there,\" said Pooh, pointing behind Kanga's back. \"No,\" said Kanga. \"Now jump in, Roo, dear , and we'll go home.\"",
  "And he picked up Roo in his paws. \"I can see a bird in it from here,\" said Pooh. \"Or is it a fish?\" \"You ought to see that bird from here,\" said Rabbit. \"Unless it's a fish.\" \"It isn't a fish, it's a bird,\" said Piglet. \"So it is,\" said Rabbit.",
  "And then at last Kanga did turn her head to look. And the moment that her head was turned, Rabbit said in a loud voice \"In you go, Roo!\" and in jumped Piglet into Kanga's pocket, and off scampered Rabbit, with Roo in his paws, as fast as he could. \"Why , where's Rabbit?\" said Kanga, turning round again.",
  "Piglet made a squeaky Roo-noise from the bottom of Kanga's pocket. \"Rabbit had to go away ,\" said Pooh. \"I think he thought of something he had to go and see about suddenly .\" \"And Piglet?\" \"I think Piglet thought of something at the same time. Suddenly .\" \"Well, we must be getting home,\" said Kanga.",
  "And in three lar ge jumps she was gone. Pooh looked after her as she went. \"I wish I could jump like that,\" he thought. \"Some can and some can't. That's how it is.\" But there were moments when Piglet wished that Kanga couldn't. Often, when he had had a long walk home through the Forest, he had wished that he were a bird; but now he thought jerkily to himself at the bottom of Kanga's pocket, \"If this is flying I shall never really take to it.\"",
  "And as he went up in the air he said, \"Ooooooo! \" and as he came down he said, \"Ow!\" And he was saying, \"Ooooooo-ow , Ooooooo-ow , Ooooooo-ow \" all the way to Kanga's house. Of course as soon as Kanga unbuttoned her pocket, she saw what had happened .",
  "Just for a moment, she thought she was frightened, and then she knew she wasn't; for she felt quite sure that Christopher Robin would never let any harm happen to Roo. So she said to herself, \"If they are having a joke with me, I will have a joke with them.\"",
  "But it wasn't a very good \"Aha! \" and Kanga didn't seem to understand what it meant. \"Bath first,\" said Kanga in a cheerful voice. \"Aha! \" said Piglet again, looking round anxiously for the others. But the others weren't there. Rabbit was playing with Baby Roo in his own house, and feeling more fond of him every minute, and Pooh, who had decided to be a Kanga, was still at the sandy place on the top of the Forest, practising jumps.",
  "Would you like that, Roo, dear?\" Piglet, who had never been really fond of baths, shuddered a long indignant shudder , and said in as brave a voice as he could: \"Kanga, I see that the time has come to spleak painly .\" \"Funny little Roo,\" said Kanga, as she got the bath-water ready .",
  "If you go on making faces like Piglet's, you will grow up to look like Piglet—and then think how sorry you will be. Now then, into the bath, and don't let me have to speak to you about it again.\" Before he knew where he was, Piglet was in the bath, and Kanga was scrubbing him firmly with a lar ge lathery flannel.",
  "I'm Piglet!\" \"Don't open the mouth, dear , or the soap goes in,\" said Kanga. \"There! What did I tell you?\" \"You—you—you did it on purpose,\" spluttered Piglet, as soon as he could speak again ... and then accidentally had another mouthful of lathery flannel. \"That's right, dear, don't say anything,\" said Kanga, and in another minute Piglet was out of the bath, and being rubbed dry with a towel. \"Now ,\" said Kanga, \"there's your medicine, and then bed.\"",
  "She keeps saying I'm Roo. I'm not Roo, am I?\" Christopher Robin looked at him very carefully , and shook his head. \"You can't be Roo,\" he said, \"because I've just seen Roo playing in Rabbit's house.\" \"Well!\" said Kanga. \"Fancy that! Fancy my making a mistake like that.\" \"There you are!\" said Piglet.",
  "I'm Piglet.\" Christopher Robin shook his head again. \"Oh, you're not Piglet,\" he said. \"I know Piglet well, and he's quite a dif ferent colour .\" Piglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath, and then he thought that perhaps he wouldn't say that, and as he opened his mouth to say something else, Kanga slipped the medicine spoon in, and then patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice taste when you got used to it. \"I knew it wasn't Piglet,\" said Kanga.",
  "Kanga agreed that this was probably what it was, and said that they would have to call it by some name. \"I shall call it Pootel,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Henry Pootel for short.\" And just when it was decided, Henry Pootel wriggled out of Kanga's arms and jumped to the ground.",
  "To his great joy Christopher Robin had left the door open. Never had Henry Pootel Piglet run so fast as he ran then, and he didn't stop running until he had got quite close to his house. But when he was a hundred yards away he stopped running, and rolled the rest of the way home, so as to get his own nice comfortable colour again....",
  "So Kanga and Roo stayed in the Forest . And every Tuesday Roo spent the day with his great friend Rabbit, and every Tuesday Kanga spent the day with her great friend Pooh, teaching him to jump , and every Tuesday Piglet spent the day with his great friend Christopher Robin.",
  "So they were all happy again. CHAPTER VIII IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER ROBIN LEADS AN EXPOTITION TO THE NORTH POLE One fine day Pooh had stumped up to the top of the Forest to see if his friend Christopher Robin was interested in Bears at all. At breakfast that morning (a simple meal of marmalade spread lightly over a honeycomb or two)",
  "It began like this: \"Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear .\" When he had got as far as this, he scratched his head, and thought to himself \"That's a very good start for a song, but what about the second line?\" He tried singing \"Ho,\" two or three times, but it didn't seem to help.",
  "So he sang it ... but it wasn't. \"Very well, then,\" he said, \"I shall sing that first line twice, and perhaps if I sing it very quickly , I shall find myself singing the third and fourth lines before I have time to think of them, and that will be a Good Song.",
  "Now then:\" Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear! Sing Ho! for the life of a Bear! I don't much mind if it rains or snows, 'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice new nose, I don't much care if it snows or thaws, 'Cos I've got a lot of honey on my nice clean paws!",
  "Sing Ho! for a Bear! Sing Ho! for a Pooh! And I'll have a little something in an hour or two! He was so pleased with this song that he sang it all the way to the top of the Forest, \"and if I go on singing it much longer ,\" he thought, \"it will be time for the little something, and then the last line won't be true.\"",
  "So he turned it into a hum instead. Christopher Robin was sitting outside his door, putting on his Big Boots. As soon as he saw the Big Boots, Pooh knew that an Adventure was going to happen, and he brushed the honey off his nose with the back of his paw, and spruced himself up as well as he could, so as to look Ready for Anything.",
  "I can't get this boot on.\" \"That's bad,\" said Pooh. \"Do you think you could very kindly lean against me, 'cos I keep pulling so hard that I fall over backwards.\" Pooh sat down, dug his feet into the ground, and pushed hard against Christopher Robin's back, and Christopher Robin pushed hard against his, and pulled and pulled at his boot until he had got it on.",
  "Where are we going to on this Expotition?\" \"Expedition, silly old Bear . It's got an 'x' in it.\" \"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"I know .\" But he didn't really . \"We're going to discover the North Pole.\" \"Oh!\" said Pooh again. \"What is the North Pole?\" he asked. \"It's just a thing you discover ,\" said Christopher Robin carelessly , not being quite sure himself.",
  "I see,\" said Pooh. \"Are bears any good at discovering it?\" \"Of course they are. And Rabbit and Kanga and all of you. It's an Expedition. That's what an Expedition means. A long line of everybody . You'd better tell the others to get ready , while I see if my gun's all right.",
  "And we're going to discover a Pole or something. Or was it a Mole? Anyhow we're going to discover it.\" \"We are, are we?\" said Rabbit. \"Yes. And we've got to bring Pro—things to eat with us. In case we want to eat them. Now I'm going down to Piglet's.",
  "Tell Kanga, will you?\" He left Rabbit and hurried down to Piglet's house. The Piglet was sitting on the ground at the door of his house blowing happily at a dandelion, and wondering whether it would be this year, next year, sometime or never . He had just discovered that it would be never , and was trying to remember what \"it\" was, and hoping it wasn't anything nice, when Pooh came up.",
  "To discover something.\" \"To discover what?\" said Piglet anxiously . \"Oh! just something.\" \"Nothing fierce?\" \"Christopher Robin didn't say anything about fierce. He just said it had an 'x'.\" \"It isn't their necks I mind,\" said Pigle t earnestly . \"It's their teeth. But if Christopher Robin is coming I don't mind anything.\"",
  "In a little while they were all ready at the top of the Forest, and the Expotition started. First came Christopher Robin and Rabbit, then Piglet and Pooh; then Kanga, with Roo in her pocket, and Owl; then Eeyore; and, at the end, in a long line, all Rabbit's friends-and-relations.",
  "They always do. They can march at the end, after Eeyore.\" \"What I say,\" said Eeyore, \"is that it's unsettling. I didn't want to come on this Expo—what Pooh said. I only came to oblige. But here I am; and if I am the end of the Expo—what we're talking about—then let me be the end.",
  "We can look for the North Pole, or we can play 'Here we go gathering Nuts and May' with the end part of an ant's nest. It's all the same to me.\" There was a shout from the top of the line. \"Come on!\" called Christopher Robin. \"Come on!\" called Pooh and Piglet. \"Come on!\" called Owl.",
  "And he hurried of f to the front of the Expotition with Christopher Robin. \"All right,\" said Eeyore. \"W e're going. Only Don't Blame Me.\" So off they all went to discover the Pole. And as they walked, they chattered to each other of this and that, all except Pooh, who was making up a song.",
  "Pooh couldn't answer that one, so he began to sing. They all went of f to discover the Pole, Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all; It's a Thing you Discover , as I've been tole By Owl and Piglet and Rabbit and all. Eeyore, Christopher Robin and Pooh And Rabbit's relations all went too— And where the Pole was none of them knew ....",
  "And the last and smallest friend-and-relation was so upset to find that the whole Expotition was saying \"Hush!\" to him, that he buried himself head downwards in a crack in the ground, and stayed there for two days until the danger was over, and then went home in a great hurry , and lived quietly with his Aunt ever- afterwards.",
  "His name was Alexander Beetle. They had come to a stream which twisted and tumbled between high rocky banks, and Christopher Robin saw at once how dangerous it was. \"It's just the place,\" he explained, \"for an Ambush.\" \"What sort of bush?\" whispered Pooh to Piglet. \"A gorse-bush?\" \"My dear Pooh,\" said Owl in his superior way , \"don't you know what an Ambush is?\" \"Owl,\" said Piglet, looking round at him severely , \"Pooh's whisper was a perfectly private whisper , and there was no need——\" \"An Ambush,\" said Owl, \"is a sort of Surprise.\"",
  "Pooh, who now knew what an Ambush was, said that a gorse-bush had sprung at him suddenly one day when he fell off a tree, and he had taken six days to get all the prickles out of himself. \"We are not talking about gorse-bushes,\" said Owl a little crossly .",
  "They were climbing very cautiously up the stream now, going from rock to rock, and after they had gone a little way they came to a place where the banks widen ed out at each side, so that on each side of the water there was a level strip of",
  "As soon as he saw this, Christopher Robin called \"Halt!\" and they all sat down and rested. \"I think,\" said Christopher Robin, \"that we ought to eat all our Provisions now , so that we shan't have so much to carry .\" \"Eat all our what?\" said Pooh. \"All that we've brought,\" said Piglet, getting to work.",
  "He looked round at them in his melancholy way. \"I suppose none of you are sitting on a thistle by any chance?\" \"I believe I am,\" said Pooh. \"Ow!\" He got up, and looked behind him. \"Y es, I was. I thought so.\" \"Thank you, Pooh. If you've quite finished with it.\"",
  "He moved across to Pooh's place, and began to eat. \"It don't do them any Good, you know , sitting on them,\" he went on, as he looked up munching. \"Takes all the Life out of them. Remember that another time, all of you. A little Consideration, a little Thought for Others, makes all the difference.\"",
  "As soon as he had finished his lunch Christopher Robin whispered to Rabbit, and Rabbit said \"Yes, yes, of course,\" and they walked a little way up the stream together . \"I didn't want the others to hear ,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Quite so,\" said Rabbit, looking important. \"It's—I wondered—It's only—Rabbit, I suppose you don't know , What does the North Pole look like?\" \"Well,\" said Rabbit, stroking his whiskers.",
  "They went back to the others. Piglet was lying on his back, sleeping peacefully . Roo was washing his face and paws in the stream, while Kanga explained to everybody proudly that this was the first time he had ever washed his face himself, and Owl was telling Kanga an Interesting Anecdote full of long words like EncyclopÃ¦dia and Rhododendron to which Kanga wasn't listening.",
  "What do you think, Pooh?\" \"Well,\" said Pooh, \" I think——\" But we shall never know what Pooh thought, for there came a sudden squeak from Roo, a splash, and a loud cry of alarm from Kanga. \"So much for washing ,\" said Eeyore. \"Roo's fallen in!\" cried Rabbit, and he and Christopher Robin came rushing down to the rescue. \"Look at me swimming!\" squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was hurried down a waterfall into the next pool.",
  "Everybody was doing something to help. Piglet, wide awake suddenly , was jumping up and down and making \"Oo, I say\" noises; Owl was explaining that in a case of Sudden and Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was to keep the Head Above Water; Kanga was jumping along the bank, saying \"Are you sure you're all right, Roo dear?\" to which Roo, from whatever pool he was in at the moment, was answering \"Look at me swimming!\" Eeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which Roo fell, and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to himself, and saying, \"All this washing; but catch on to my tail, little Roo, and you'll be all right\"; and, Christopher Robin and Rabbit came hurrying past Eeyore, and were calling out to the others in front of them. \"All right, Roo, I'm coming,\" called Christopher Robin.",
  "But Pooh was getting something. Two pools below Roo he was standing with a long pole in his paws, and Kanga came up and took one end of it, and between them they held it across the lower part of the pool; and Roo, still bubbling proudly , \"Look at me swimming,\" drifted up against it, and climbed out.",
  "That's called swimming, what I was doing. Rabbit, did you see what I was doing? Swimming. Hallo, Piglet! I say , Piglet! What do you think I was doing! Swimming! Christopher Robin, did you see me——\" But Christopher Robin wasn't listening. He was looking at Pooh. \"Pooh,\" he said, \"where did you find that pole?\" Pooh looked at the pole in his hands.",
  "I don't want to mention it, but I just mention it. I don't want to complain but there it is. My tail's cold.\" \"Here I am!\" squeaked Roo. \"Oh, there you are.\" \"Did you see me swimming?\" Eeyore took his tail out of the water , and swished it from side to side.",
  "Numbed it. That's what it's done. Numbed it. Well, as long as nobody minds, I suppose it's all right.\" \"Poor old Eeyore. I'll dry it for you,\" said Christopher Robin, and he took out his handkerchief and rubbed it up. \"Thank you, Christopher Robin. You're the only one who seems to understand about tails.",
  "They don't think—that's what the matter with some of these others. They've no imagination. A tail isn't a tail to them , it's just a Little Bit Extra at the back.\" \"Never mind, Eeyore,\" said Christopher Robin, rubbing his hardest. \"Is that better?\" \"It's feeling more like a tail perhaps.",
  "It Belongs again, if you know what I mean.\" \"Hullo, Eeyore,\" said Pooh, coming up to them with his pole. \"Hullo, Pooh. Thank you for asking, but I shall be able to use it again in a day or two.\" \"Use what?\" said Pooh. \"What we are talking about.\" \"I wasn't talking about anything,\" said Pooh, looking puzzled.",
  "Pooh looked anxiously at Christopher Robin. \"Pooh's found the North Pole,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Isn't that lovely?\" Pooh looked modestly down. \"Is that it?\" said Eeyore. \"Yes,\" said Christopher Robin. \"Is that what we were looking for?\" \"Yes,\" said Pooh. \"Oh!\" said Eeyore. \"W ell, anyhow—it didn't rain,\" he said.",
  "They stuck the pole in the ground, and Christopher Robin tied a message on to it. NOR TH POLE DISCOVERED BY POOH POOH FOUND IT . Then they all went home again. And I think, but I am not quite sure, that Roo had a hot bath and went straight to bed.",
  "But Pooh went back to his own house, and feeling very proud of what he had done, had a little something to revive himself. CHAPTER IX IN WHICH PIGLET IS ENTIRELY SURROUNDED BY WATER It rained and it rained and it rained. Piglet told himself that never in all his life, and he was goodness knows how old— three, was it, or four?—never had he seen so much rain.",
  "Days and days and days. \"If only,\" he thought, as he looked out of the window , \"I had been in Pooh's house, or Christopher Robin's house, or Rabbit's house when it began to rain, then I should have had Company all this time, instead of being here all alone, with nothing to do except wonder when it will stop.\" And he imagined himself with Pooh, saying, \"Did you ever see such rain, Pooh?\"",
  "For it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in which Piglet had nosed about so often had become streams, the little streams across which he had splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose steep banks they had played so happily , had sprawled out of its own bed and was taking up so much room everywhe re, that Piglet was beginning to wonder whether it would be coming into his bed soon.",
  "Christopher Robin and Pooh could escape by Climbing Trees, and Kanga could escape by Jumping, and Rabbit could escape by Burrowing, and Owl could escape by Flying, and Eeyore could escape by—by Making a Loud Noise Until Rescued, and here am I, surrounded by water and I can't do anything .\"",
  "It went on raining, and every day the water got a little higher , until now it was nearly up to Piglet's window ... and still he hadn't done anything. \"There's Pooh,\" he thought to himself. \"Pooh hasn't much Brain, but he never comes to any harm. He does silly things and they turn out right.",
  "There's Owl. Owl hasn't exactly got Brain, but he Knows Things. He would know the Right Thing to Do when Surrounded by Water. There's Rabbit. He hasn't Learnt in Books, but he can always Think of a Clever Plan. There's Kanga. She isn't Clever , Kanga isn't, but she would be so anxious about Roo that she would do a Good Thing to Do without thinking about It.",
  "And then there's Eeyore. And Eeyore is so miserable anyhow that he wouldn't mind about this. But I wonder what Christopher Robin would do?\" Then suddenly he remembered a story which Christopher Robin had told him about a man on a desert island who had written something in a bottle and thrown it in the sea; and Piglet thought that if he wrote something in a bottle and threw it in the water , perhaps somebody would come and rescue him!",
  "He left the window and began to search his house, all of it that wasn't under water , and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry paper , and a bottle with a cork to it. And he wrote on one side of the paper: HELP!",
  "IT'S ME PIGLET , HELP HELP . Then he put the paper in the bottle, and he corked the bottle up as tightly as he could, and he leant out of his window as far as he could lean without falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could throw— splash! —and in a little while it bobbed up again on the water; and he watched it floating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes ached with looking, and sometimes he thought it was the bottle, and sometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was following, and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again and that he had done all that he could do to save himself.",
  "And then he gave a very long sigh and said, \"I wish Pooh were here. It's so much more friendly with two.\" When the rain began Pooh was asleep. It rained, and it rained, and it rained, and he slept and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day.",
  "You remember how he discovered the North Pole; well, he was so proud of this that he asked Christopher Robin if there were any other Poles such as a Bear of Little Brain might discover . \"There's a South Pole,\" said Christophe r Robin, \"and I expect there's an East Pole and a West Pole, though people don't like talking about them.\" Pooh was very excited when he heard this, and suggested that they should have an Expotition to discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had thought of something else to do with Kanga; so Pooh went out to discover the East Pole by himself.",
  "Whether he discovered it or not, I forget; but he was so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of his supper , after he had been eating for little more than half-an-hour , he fell fast asleep in his chair , and slept and slept and slept.",
  "Then suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the East Pole, and it was a very cold pole with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had found a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn't room for his legs, so he had left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as inhabit the East Pole, came and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make nests for their Young.",
  "And the more they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly he woke up with an Ow!—and there he was, sitting in his chair with his feet in the water , and water all round him! He splashed to his door and looked out.... \"This is Serious,\" said Pooh.",
  "So he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad branch of his tree, well above the water , and then he climbed down again and escaped with another pot ... and when the whole Escap e was finished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and there, beside him, were ten pots of honey ....",
  "Two days later , there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and there, beside him, were four pots of honey .... Three days later , there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and there beside him, was one pot of honey . Four days later , there was Pooh ...",
  "And it was on the morning of the fourth day that Piglet's bottle came floating past him, and with one loud cry of \"Honey!\" Pooh plunged into the water , seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again. \"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he opened it. \"All that wet for nothing.",
  "What's that bit of paper doing?\" He took it out and looked at it. \"It's a Missage,\" he said to himself, \"that's what it is. And that letter is a 'P,' and so is that, and so is that, and 'P' means 'Pooh,' so it's a very important Missage to me, and I can't read it.",
  "I must find Christopher Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers who can read things, and they will tell me what this missage means. Only I can't swim. Bother!\" Then he had an idea, and I think that for a Bear of Very Little Brain, it was a good idea.",
  "So he took his biggest jar, and corked it up. \"All boats have to have a name,\" he said, \"so I shall call mine The Floating Bear .\" And with these words he dropped his boat into the water and jumped in after it. For a little while Pooh and The Floating Bear were uncertain as to which of them was meant to be on the top, but after trying one or two different positions, they settled down with The Floating Bear underneath and Pooh triumphantly astride it, paddling vigorously with his feet.",
  "Christopher Robin lived at the very top of the Forest. It rained, and it rained, and it rained, but the water couldn't come up to his house. It was rather jolly to look down into the valleys and see the water all round him, but it rained so hard that he stayed indoors most of the time, and thought about things.",
  "Every morning he went out with his umbrella and put a stick in the place where the water came up to, and every next morning he went out and couldn't see his stick any more, so he put another stick in the place where the water came up to, and then he walked home again, and each morning he had a shorter way to walk than he had had the morning before.",
  "It was on this morning that Owl came flying over the water to say \"How do you do,\" to his friend Christopher Robin. \"I say , Owl,\" said Christopher Robin, \"isn't this fun? I'm on an island!\" \"The atmospheric conditions have been very unfavourable lately ,\" said Owl. \"The what?\"",
  "At any moment——\" \"Have you seen Pooh?\" \"No. At any moment——\" \"I hope he's all right,\" said Christopher Robin. \"I've been wondering about him. I expect Piglet's with him. Do you think they're all right, Owl?\" \"I expect so. You see, at any moment——\" \"Do go and see, Owl. Because Pooh hasn't got very much brain, and he might do something silly, and I do love him so, Owl.",
  "Do you see, Owl?\" \"That's all right,\" said Owl. \"I'll go. Back directly .\" And he flew of f. In a little while he was back again. \"Pooh isn't there,\" he said. \"Not there?\" \"Has been there. He's been sitting on a branch of his tree outside his house with nine pots of honey .",
  "They rushed into each other's arms. \"How did you get here, Pooh?\" asked Christopher Robin, when he was ready to talk again. \"On my boat,\" said Pooh proudly . \"I had a Very Important Missage sent me in a bottle, and owing to having got some water in my eyes, I couldn't read it, so I brought it to you.",
  "On my boat.\" With these proud words he gave Christopher Robin the missage. \"But it's from Piglet!\" cried Christopher Robin when he had read it. \"Isn't there anything about Pooh in it?\" asked Bear , looking over his shoulder . Christopher Robin read the message aloud. \"Oh, are those 'P's' piglets? I thought they were poohs.\"",
  "I thought he was with you, Pooh. Owl, could you rescue him on your back?\" \"I don't think so,\" said Owl, after grave thought. \"It is doubtful if the necessary dorsal muscles——\" \"Then would you fly to him at once and say that Rescue is Coming? And Pooh and I will think of a Rescue and come as quick as ever we can.",
  "Oh, don't talk, Owl, go on quick!\" And, still thinking of something to say , Owl flew of f. \"Now then, Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin, \"where's your boat?\" \"I ought to say,\" explained Pooh as they walked down to the shore of the island, \"that it isn't just an ordinary sort of boat.",
  "Sometimes it's a Boat, and sometimes it's more of an Accident. It all depends.\" \"Depends on what?\" \"On whether I'm on the top of it or underneath it.\" \"Oh! Well, where is it?\" \"There!\" said Pooh, pointing proudly to The Floating Bear . It wasn't what Christopher Robin expected, and the more he looked at it, the more he thought what a Brave and Clever Bear Pooh was, and the more Christopher Robin thought this, the more Pooh looked modestly down his nose and tried to pretend he wasn't. \"But it's too small for two of us,\" said Christopher Robin sadly .",
  "Christopher Robin could only look at him with mouth open and eyes staring, wondering if this was really the Bear of Very Little Brain whom he had known and loved so long. \"We might go in your umbrella,\" said Pooh. \"?\" \"We might go in your umbrella,\" said Pooh. \"? ?\" \"We might go in your umbrella,\" said Pooh. \"!!!!!!\"",
  "For suddenly Christopher Robin saw that they might. He opened his umbrella and put it point downwards in the water . It floated but wobbled. Pooh got in. He was just beginning to say that it was all right now, when he found that it wasn't, so after a short drink which he didn't really want he waded back to Christopher Robin.",
  "You can imagine Piglet's joy when at last the ship came in sight of him. In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had really been in was in the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like this sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally , slipping slowly out of the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment luckily , a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was really part of the story , being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, \"How interesting, and did she?\"",
  "And that is really the end of the story , and I am very tired after that last sentence, I think I shall stop there. CHAPTER X IN WHICH CHRISTOPHER ROBIN GIVES POOH A PARTY, AND WE SAY GOOD-BYE One day when the sun had come back over the Forest, bringing with it the scent of may, and all the streams of the Forest were tinkling happily to find themselves their own pretty shape again, and the little pools lay dreaming of the life they had seen and the big things they had done, and in the warmth and quiet of the Forest the cuckoo was trying over his voice carefully and listening to see if he liked it, and wood-pigeons were complaining gently to themselves in their lazy comfortable way that it was the other fellow's fault, but it didn't matter very much; on such a day as this Christopher Robin whistled in a special way he had, and Owl came flying out of the Hundred Acre Wood to see what was wanted. \"Owl,\" said Christopher Robin, \"I am going to give a party .\" \"You are, are you?\" said Owl.",
  "Owl tried to think of something very wise to say, but couldn't, so he flew off to tell the others. And the first person he told was Pooh. \"Pooh,\" he said, \"Christopher Robin is giving a party .\" \"Oh!\" said Pooh. And then seeing that Owl expected him to say something else, he said \"Will there be those little cake things with pink sugar icing?\" Owl felt that it was rather beneath him to talk about little cake things with pink sugar icing, so he told Pooh exactly what Christopher Robin had said, and flew of f to Eeyore.",
  "And he began to wonder if all the other animals would know that it was a special Pooh Party , and if Christopher Robin had told them about The Floating Bear and the Brain of Pooh and all the wonderful ships he had inven ted and sailed on, and he began to think how awful it would be if everybody had forgotten about it, and nobody quite knew what the party was for; and the more he thought like this, the more the party got muddled in his mind, like a dream when nothing goes right.",
  "And the dream began to sing itself over in his head until it became a sort of song. It was an ANXIOUS POOH SONG. 3 Cheers for Pooh! (For Who? ) For Pooh— (Why what did he do? ) I thought you knew; He saved his friend from a wetting!",
  "For Bear— He couldn't swim, But he rescued him! (He rescued who? ) Oh, listen, do! I am talking of Pooh— (Of who? ) Of Pooh! (I'm sorry I keep for getting ). Well, Pooh was a Bear of Enormous Brain (Just say it again! ) Of enormous brain— (Of enormous what? )",
  "Well, he ate a lot, And I don't know if he could swim or not, But he managed to float On a sort of boat (On a sort of what? ) Well, a sort of pot— So now let's give him three hearty cheers (So now let's give him thr ee hearty whiches? )",
  "And hope he'll be with us for years and years, And grow in health and wisdom and riches! 3 Cheers for Pooh! (For who? ) For Pooh— 3 Cheers for Bear! (For wher e?) For Bear— 3 Cheers for the wonderful Winnie-the-Pooh! (Just tell me, somebody —WHA T DID HE DO?)",
  "While this was going on inside him, Owl was talking to Eeyore. \"Eeyore,\" said Owl, \"Christopher Robin is giving a party .\" \"Very interesting,\" said Eeyore. \"I supp ose they will be sending me down the odd bits which got trodden on. Kind and Thoughtful. Not at all, don't mention it.\"",
  "Who dropped it?\" \"This isn't anything to eat, it's asking you to the party . To-morrow .\" Eeyore shook his head slowly . \"You mean Piglet. The little fellow with the excited ears. That's Piglet. I'll tell him.\" \"No, no!\" said Owl, getting quite fussy . \"It's you!\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Of course I'm sure.",
  "Christopher Robin said 'All of them! Tell all of them.'\" \"All of them, except Eeyore?\" \"All of them,\" said Owl sulkily . \"Ah!\" said Eeyore. \"A mistake, no doubt, but still, I shall come. Only don't blame me if it rains.\" But it didn't rain. Christopher Robin had made a long table out of some long pieces of wood, and they all sat round it. Christopher Robin sat at one end, and Pooh sat at the other , and between them on one side were Owl and Eeyore and Piglet, and between them on the other side were Rabbit, and",
  "It was the first party to which Roo had ever been, and he was very excited. As soon as ever they had sat down he began to talk. \"Hallo, Pooh!\" he squeaked. \"Hallo, Roo!\" said Pooh. Roo jumped up and down in his seat for a little while and then began again.",
  "Piglet waved a paw at him, being too busy to say anything. \"Hallo, Eeyore!\" said Roo. Eeyore nodded gloomily at him. \"It will rain soon, you see if it doesn't,\" he said. Roo looked to see if it didn't, and it didn't, so he said \"Hallo, Owl!\"—and Owl said \"Hallo, my little fellow ,\" in a kindly way, and went on telling Christopher Robin about an accident which had nearly happened to a friend of his whom Christopher Robin didn't know , and Kanga said to Roo, \"Drink up your milk first, dear, and talk afterwards.\" So Roo, who was drinking his milk, tried to say that he could do both at once ... and had to be patted on the back and dried for quite a long time afterwards.",
  "Then he felt about a little and whispered, \"Where is it?\" While he was looking, Eeyore coughed in an impressive way and began to speak. \"Friends,\" he said, \"including oddments, it is a great pleasure, or perhaps I had better say it has been a pleasure so far, to see you at my party .",
  "What I did was nothing. Any of you—except Rabbit and Owl and Kanga—would have done the same. Oh, and Pooh. My remarks do not, of course, apply to Piglet and Roo, because they are too small. Any of you would have done the same. But it just happened to be Me.",
  "It was not, I need hardly say, with an idea of getting what Christopher Robin is looking for now\"— and he put his front leg to his mouth and said in a loud whisper , \"Try under the table\"—\"that I did what I did—but because I feel that we should all do what we can to help.",
  "I feel that we should all ——\" \"H—hup!\" said Roo accidentally . \"Roo, dear!\" said Kanga reproachfully . \"Was it me?\" asked Roo, a little surprised. \"What's Eeyore talking about?\" Piglet whispered to Pooh. \"I don't know ,\" said Pooh rather dolefully . \"I thought this was your party .\"",
  "But I suppose it isn't.\" \"I'd sooner it was yours than Eeyore's,\" said Piglet. \"So would I,\" said Pooh. \"H—hup!\" said Roo again. \"AS—I—W AS—SA YING,\" said Eeyore loudly and sternly , \"as I was saying when I was interrupted by various Loud Sounds, I feel that——\" \"Here it is!\" cried Christopher Robin excitedly .",
  "It's for Pooh.\" \"For Pooh?\" said Eeyore. \"Of course it is. The best bear in all the world.\" \"I might have known,\" said Eeyore. \"After all, one can't complain. I have my friends. Somebody spoke to me only yesterday . And was it last week or the week before that Rabbit bumped into me and said 'Bother!'",
  "Always something going on.\" Nobody was listening, for they were all saying \"Open it, Pooh,\" \"What is it, Pooh?\" \"I know what it is,\" \"No, you don't\" and other helpful remarks of this sort. And of course Pooh was opening it as quickly as ever he could, but without cutting the string, because you never know when a bit of string might be Useful.",
  "At last it was undone. When Pooh saw what it was, he nearly fell down, he was so pleased. It was a Special Pencil Case. There were pencils in it marked \"B\" for Bear, and pencils marked \"HB\" for Helping Bear, and pencils marked \"BB\" for Brave Bear. There was a knife for sharpening the pencils, and india-rubber for rubbing out anything which you had spelt wrong, and a ruler for ruling lines for the words to walk on, and inches marked on the ruler in case you wanted to know how many inches anything was, and Blue Pencils and Red Pencils and Green Pencils for saying special things in blue and red and green.",
  "And all these lovely things were in little pockets of their own in a Special Case which shut with a click when you clicked it. And they were all for Pooh. \"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"Oh, Pooh!\" said everybody else except Eeyore. \"Thank-you,\" growled Pooh. But Eeyore was saying to himself, \"This writing business.",
  "Pooh nodded thoughtfully . \"It's the same thing,\" he said. \"And what did happen?\" asked Christopher Robin. \"When?\" \"Next morning.\" \"I don't know .\" \"Could you think and tell me and Pooh some time?\" \"If you wanted it very much.\" \"Pooh does,\" said Christopher Robin. He gave a deep sigh, picked his bear up by the leg and walked off to the door, trailing Winnie-the-Pooh behind him.",
  "At the door he turned and said \"Coming to see me have my bath?\" \"I might,\" I said. \"Was Pooh's pencil case any better than mine?\" \"It was just the same,\" I said. He nodded and went out ... and in a moment I heard Winnie-the-Pooh— bump, bump, bump —going up the stairs behind him."
